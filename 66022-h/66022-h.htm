</div>
<hr class="small" />


<p>The relations of man to his God have occupied the
first minds of every age, but without rendering those
relations so understandable to the mass of mankind as
to be admitted as true. It has been evident to many,
although not to all, that some minds so engaged have
been inspired to write beyond the current knowledge
of their day, indeed to foretell truths which could only
be recognized as such after centuries of progression.</p>

<p>The natural propensity of the human mind in the
exercise of its ingenuity has been constantly developing
in the endeavor to theorize upon the writings of these
inspired authors, so as to present an entire system for
the consideration of man. Each of these systems so
proposed has passed away, from the fact that it carried
with it the elements of its own destruction, itself
not arising purely from the absolute, and therefore subject
to the analysis of progressed mind, and by such
analysis found wanting. Those theories which might
have seemed compatible with the ability to adjudge
truth in the middle ages, were not truths to the more
progressed minds of later times; so that truth, except
to absolute consciousness, may be considered, when
subject to the test of human comprehension, as not absolute
even to such comprehension, except in degree,
and that varying with the continued progression of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
recipient. Thus the best minds at this time willingly
admit that the writer of Job was inspired—that he
wrote truths beyond the comprehension of more than a
thousand years beyond his time. One instance of this
may be thus stated:</p>

<p>To Galileo and Copernicus we have attributed the
discovery of the fact that the world is round; and yet
the writer of the Book of Job, who wrote a thousand
years before them, tells us that the earth is round, that
its north is frigid, that the waters are divided by the
dry land, where the day becomes night, and the night
becomes day—clearly indicating that the continents are
twelve hours apart, and that the earth must revolve to
enable the relative position of its parts to the sun to
give the phenomena now so well understood.</p>

<p>Plato was an inspired man. He wrote on the soul,
far in advance of his day; and it is only a progressed
mind at this time that can read and comprehend his
views. With Plato, all admit that his normal progression
might have been equal to the observance of
the results of his inspiration. But the writer of the
Book of Job could never have seen an ocean. He could
not have known of the existence of another continent,
and the sciences collateral to his text could not have
rendered him the didactic aid which would have been
necessary to have made him cognizant, in his normal
condition, of the truths he uttered; and, therefore, it
is at least possible, if not probable, that these truths
were directly the result of inspiration, as much beyond
his own comprehension as beyond the comprehension
of others. Indeed, even at the present day, thousands
of students of theology have read Job without perceiv<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>ing
that he had fore-run Galileo and Copernicus in
their supposed discoveries.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at, then, that modern Spiritualism
and its truths, if credited to the source from
which they are supposed to be derived, should be
found to present truths not understood as such by
every mind; and, notwithstanding its million converts,
it seems to have embraced but few minds capable
of presenting in a didactic form these truths.
The various writers on the subject have rather spoken
of its curiosities than its use; and we know of no
book capable of instructing and satisfying even a progressed
mind on either the precise use or exact advantages
arising from a full belief in Spiritualism.</p>

<p>This task has been most fearlessly performed by Joel
Tiffany, Esq. He brought to the work a vigorous
and original mind. A long course of legal practice had
peculiarly adapted him to the task, particularly as an
investigator of truth. His own progression was such
as to enable him to advantage by his former practice,
while his mediative power gave him intuitive advantage
seldom combined in the same individual.
His course of lectures seems to be suited to the precise
wants of the day. It is true that they are not calculated
for the use of the novice, but they are the
only source we know of at this time by which those
who have passed through the curiosity-phase of the
subject of Spiritualism are enabled to review their
observations and apply them usefully to their own
progression. All those properties of the mind known
as <i>adjective</i> in common parlance, requiring the assistance
of the observation of others to render them
substantive, are clearly defined by Mr. Tiffany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span></p>

<p>His analysis of mind, when properly understood,
enables all the truths he has set forth to be read understandingly;
in other words he gives the <i>modus</i>
by which we may determine truths at least equal to the
progressed condition of man at this time to comprehend.</p>

<p>The Sphere of Lust, that greatest bar to man’s progression,
both in its analysis and synthesis, is placed
within his comprehension, and hence his power of
avoidance is materially increased. The fabled terrors
of Hades, Sheol, Tartarus, and Gehenna are defined
so as to be comprehended by an ordinary individual,
while the relational sphere of man is so
treated as to enable each reader to define his own position,
and those below him, sufficiently well to assist
in his aspirations for higher exercise.</p>

<p>Communication and Progression are fearlessly
treated, and the master-mind is observable in all the
collateral incidents of thought consequent upon their
investigation.</p>

<p>Mediumship is rendered understandable to all, and
those phases which have been unproductive of good
results to minds not elevated beyond the consideration
consequent upon the morbid appetites of the curious,
are fairly depicted so as to enable the investigator
to avoid their recurrence, and to progress beyond
their painful influences.</p>

<p>Mr. Tiffany has judiciously failed to cater to the
tastes of those who but magnify Kings to conceive of
Gods. He has presented the Deity, or the consideration
of the Deity, to the minds of his audience, in
such a manner as to call forth the highest feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
of the soul for the comprehension of the highest
truth.</p>

<p>The condition of the Spirit in the Spirit-world, as
portrayed by him, is freed from the melo-dramatic
condition in which it has been painted by the fashionable
and various theologians of the day. The character
of those Spirits is shown to be in accordance
with the great law of God—Progression.</p>

<p>While we freely admit the usefulness and beauty
of many works written on abstract phases of Spiritualism,
we can not but perceive a want of continuity
in their didactic character; and from the point where
the mind admits a future state of existence to the
supposed character of that existence and the proper
preparation of the Spirit while in the form for entering
upon such a condition, we can not but observe
that no work preceding these Lectures by Mr.
Tiffany has met the demand. A careful reading of
these Lectures, we are confident, will elevate and instruct
every Spiritualist. It will enable him to review
his intuitions, and to find their true value. It
will chasten his confidence in communications which
are not self-evident as truths, and improve his power
to comprehend these truths.</p>

<p>We ask the reader to peruse the following pages
no more rapidly than he can clearly comprehend
them. Every proposition is worthy his best thought
and highest power of study; and if he follows them
with the same pure aspiration that seems to imbue
their author, he will rise from their consideration a
wiser and a better man.</p>

<small>ON THE DETERMINATION OF TRUTH.</small></h2></div>


<p>In commencing the investigation of Spiritualism, it
becomes necessary in the outset that we find some
point from which to start, or to commence our examination;
for, in the inquiry after truth, we must find
some standard by which we can determine truth—for
unless we have that to which we can appeal to determine
infallibly what is truth, however much we may
investigate, we shall always be uncertain as to the
accuracy of our conclusions.</p>

<p>Man, as a conscious being, endowed with the faculty
of perceiving being and existence, and also being
susceptible to the influence of that which he perceives,
himself becomes the center of all his investigations
in the universe; and if there is any standard
by which to try truth, he must find that standard within
his own consciousness. Outside of man’s consciousness
there is no standard to him of truth.</p>

<p>I will illustrate briefly what I mean, that you may
perceive how I wish to direct you in the investigation
of the question, What is Truth? and how shall it be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
determined? The science of mathematics is said to be
certain and demonstrative. And why is the science of
mathematics any more demonstrable than is any other
science? Why is it that the truth which it affirms can
be any more positively demonstrated than any other
truth? Is it because number and quantity are more
fixed and certain than are qualities and attributes of
being and existence? Why is it that the affirmations
of mathematics are more demonstrable than the truths
of any other science? I answer, that it is simply owing
to the mode of proceeding in our investigations. If
we will adopt the same process that we do in mathematics,
we can have the same certainty upon all other
questions that come within the sphere of man’s perceptions
and affections. The mathematician comes
down into his own consciousness, and finds certain
conscious affirmations pertaining to number and quantity.
He puts them down as truths not to be disregarded,
and calls them self-evident truths or axioms.
They are such affirmations of the consciousness as
everybody must, per force, admit to be true; and when
he has obtained the affirmations of his consciousness
pertaining to number and quantity, he puts them down
as truths not to be disregarded. They are always true
everywhere, and under all circumstances, where number
and quantity are to be investigated. He assumes
nothing to be true which conflicts with these conscious
affirmations of the soul. “Things equal to the same
thing are equal to one another” must be received as
true throughout the wide universe, so far as the
mathematician investigates; and he allows nothing to
controvert that self-evident truth; and so of all other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
affirmations. He allows nothing, in his investigations,
to conflict at all; and whatever does conflict, he affirms
to be false. Then, before he takes another step, he is
very careful to fix upon accurate definitions, so that we
may know precisely what he means—may understand
exactly the scope of what he says. For instance,
speaking of geometry, he will say that it pertains to
the measurement of extent, and extent has three dimensions—length,
breadth, and thickness. He next
goes on to give definitions of that which is necessary
to bound space—tells you what is a straight line, what
a curved line, what is a plain surface, what is a curved
surface, etc. After having ascertained the affirmations
of the consciousness of the soul, in respect to number
and quantity, and having fixed accurately upon the
definition of all terms to be used, he then commences
by demonstration, and will not go one step faster than
demonstration attends him—does not launch at all into
conjecture. He makes the relation between premises
and conclusion inevitable; and if there be not an inevitable
relation, he does not establish his proposition
mathematically.</p>

<p>Now, what is true in respect to mathematics, is true
in respect to every other subject that may come before
the mind. There are conscious affirmations of the soul
lying at the basis of all investigation; and in these
conscious affirmations of the soul is to be found the
standard by which to try the truth of whatever plane
or sphere of thought. The first point to be taken is
to ascertain what are the affirmations of the soul upon
these points to be investigated. Our next step is to
fix upon certain definitions, so that we can always un<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>derstand
precisely what we mean in our use of terms.
Then we must see next that the relation between premises
and conclusion be always inevitable. There
must never be left any opportunity for the premises to
be true and the conclusion false. Then we shall always
be certain of having the truth.</p>

<p>In investigating the science of mind and spirit, I
propose to pursue this mathematical course; and not
attempt to argue any point that is not capable of
demonstration—that is not based upon the absolute
affirmation of the soul, conducted with reference to
strict definitions, and making the relation of premises
and conclusion inevitable. The reason of being thus
particular is, that the greatest confusion prevails, not
only in respect to the subject of the New Philosophy,
or Spiritualism, but in respect to all subjects pertaining
to spiritual life. Man does not know precisely
where to begin his investigation. He does not seem
to know precisely where he is certain of any thing pertaining
to spiritual existence, and thinks that it must
be all conjectural.</p>

<p>Now here is an affirmation which I believe every
man in the audience will agree to be an affirmation of
every one’s consciousness, and that it lies at the basis
of all our investigation of this and every other subject.
(I will say further, that, if any individual in the audience
disagrees with me, he will confer a favor by
manifesting that disagreement at any time; because
I wish to be exceedingly near to you as a lecturer, and
wish you to be exceedingly near to me, so that there
may be the most perfect freedom of intercourse of
thought and expression between us.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>Then the first affirmation of the consciousness is this:
That the mind can perceive nothing but its own consciousness,
and that which is inwrought into that consciousness.</p>

<p>Now I wish you to try that in every possible way,
to see if be true. We talk about getting information
and forming ideas from subjects outside of ourselves,
as though it were independent of our minds.
My proposition is, that the mind can perceive nothing
but its own consciousness, and that which is inwrought
into that consciousness; and, furthermore, that its perception
of being and existence will be according as it
is inwrought into its consciousness; and by no possibility
can it be anything else to the individual; and,
as a matter of course, if there be any standard anywhere
by which to try truth, and know that it is true,
that standard must be inwrought into the consciousness
of the individual who has to apply it; and he will
apply it accordingly as it is inwrought into his consciousness.
Now is there any one that does not perceive
that this is absolutely true? Then receiving that
as a truth which every mind affirms—it can not suppose
the contrary of it to be true—we must set down
every thing as false which conflicts with this proposition,
no matter whether it overthrows authority or not.
Whatever conflicts with this self-evident truth, or
affirmation of universal consciousness, must be false.
Truth does not conflict with truth. You may be assured
that falsehood always exists where you find conflict
and antagonism. It follows then, that all there is
of being or of existence in the universe that will ever
be known to you or me will be that which is inwrought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
into our consciousness. It follows, as a matter of
course, the universe can be no larger and no more perfect,
than it can be inwrought into our consciousness;
and it will be limited to us by our mental unfolding.
Hence it will necessarily follow, that different individuals
who are differently unfolded in the different
departments of their intellectual and perceptional natures,
will perceive being and existence in very different
lights; and yet each will suppose that each sees it
in the same lights, until we begin to compare notes.
There will be as many different New Yorks as there
are different minds to form images or conceptions of
New York. So there will be as many different mental
Earths or mental universes as there are minds to form
conceptions of our Earth and the universe; and each
mind will have the Earth or the universe fashioned into
his own consciousness, and when it will investigate, it
will investigate that which is then fashioned therein,
and study it as fashioned there. It follows then, as a
matter of course, that when the image of the existence
within our consciousness corresponds to the actuality,
that is, when the ideal in man corresponds to the real
in God, then man has the truth—not till then. That
is, when my perception of being and existence corresponds
with the being and existence, then I have the
truth of being and existence. But just so far as my
idea or perception of being or existence deviates from
its actuality, just so far my impression is false. These
conclusions follow as a matter of necessity. Hence
you and I will learn at once, that the first lesson for
us to learn in commencing the study of the universe,
is to learn ourselves. The very first volume that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
opened before us, is that which God has given us in
giving us a conscious being. Here we must commence
our first lesson, because every thing must be recorded
in the pages of this volume. God can never
manifest any part of the universe or himself to us beyond
the capacity of the pages of this volume to receive
that manifestation. It follows then, as a matter
of course, that truth can never be communicated by
authority; and when a man tells me that a certain
thing is true upon his authority, I can not receive it
simply upon his statement. You will understand that
I distinguish between stating a truth and narrating
a fact. I may receive a statement of fact upon authority.</p>

<p>A man may tell me that there is such a place as London,
and I believe it; and I may form an idea respecting
it; but the ideal London I have in my mind is
very far from being the real London—is very far from
being a representation of the real London. That is, the
ideal London which I have exists only in my mind,
has no representative corresponding in the outward
matter-of-fact London. But when the real London is
brought into my consciousness, I have <i>the</i> London.
Before, I had a sort of <i>a</i> London. Now you will understand
what is meant by a difference between forming
a conception of a fact and a truth. Suppose I
should say to you that the sum of the squares of the
two sides of a right-angled triangle is equal to the
square of its hypotenuse, you having faith in my capacity
to determine truth will say, “I will believe it
as a fact; but I have no perception of its truth—I
have only your word for it.” Now your faith is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
in the truth of the proposition, but in my word. There
is a truth there, but you can not receive it upon my
authority. The reception of it as a truth depends upon
your mind being unfolded to the plane of that truth.
The question then for us to settle is, whether the conception
in our minds corresponds to the actuality. If
we have the means of determining that it does correspond,
then we have the means of determining that our
perception is true. The truth is the perception by
the mind of that which is. You may apply this rule
to any sphere of investigation that you please. Then
let us begin with man as a microcosm of the universe,
and who is destined in his spiritual unfolding to be a
microcosm of all that is in the universe; in other words,
whose mind here is to begin to translate the universe
into its consciousness. The universe is a great book,
which it is man’s business to read and translate into
his consciousness, so that the image within shall correspond
to the actuality without—so that he shall be
a universe of himself—so that the individual in his
affection by that which is transferred also becomes a
divine, a god. “Is it not written in your law, I said
ye are gods?” Man is to become in his impulses and
character like the divine of the universe, so that he
has not only all the wisdom, fact, and principle, but
all the affection of the universe, to wit, the divine
translated into his affection, so that in his outward
form and inward being he is a child of God, created
in his image. Thus, so far as we proceed day by day
in translating the actual and real universe into the perceptive
and ideal in us, so fast are we unfolding and
growing up into knowledge; and when that knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
is united with the truth and affectional impulses converted
into wisdom, we are made temples for the in-dwelling
of the divine spirit. It becomes us, then, to
make use of all means within our power to perceive
this great volume that God has opened before us, and
given us the means of studying, translating into our
minds, and making our own. Looking at man, then,
as a conscious being, one that possesses the faculty of
perceiving existence in all its various modes of manifestation,
and also of perceiving being itself, thus
having within himself that whereon God can write not
only the phenomena, but the law and science of being
itself, let us become free men, lovers of the truth, determined
to be honest with ourselves and the world,
determined to know what can be known, and not to be
deceived either by our own appetites, passions, or
lusts, or by the influences that others may extend over
us to turn away our minds from earnestly and truthfully
investigating all subjects. The mind that is
afraid to look upon the wide universe, to receive the
image that God would impress upon it every day and
moment of his life, is denying the birthright of his
soul.</p>

<p>Man, as a conscious being, is the subject of three
degrees of conscious perception—he can be subject
to no less and no more; and being influenced by
what he perceives—three degrees of affection. In
other words, there is laid the foundation for three
spheres of thought and three spheres of affection. He
can possess no more—no less. Now I am to demonstrate
this to be true in such a way that every one of
you shall know its truth. I begin first to prove that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
these spheres of knowledge and affection exist in you,
because it is my business, after having proved this—if
I should succeed in proving it—to show that in the
wide universe there are but those same three spheres
of knowledge and those same three spheres of affection
and love—no less and no more; that man possesses
within himself the elements of all knowledge and affection
that exist in the wide universe. Unless he did
possess these elements, he could not investigate the
universe; for he can only investigate that, the elements
of which exist within his consciousness. In the first
place, man has that faculty by which he perceives the
mere phenomena of existence, or, in other words, he
has that department of conscious being which is addressed
by what we call the physical senses, the scope
of which is to reveal to him facts and phenomena in the
material plane of existence. The physical senses can
only reveal to him the facts and phenomena. In this
respect man differs not at all from the animal, which
possesses the same number of physical senses, and is
impressed by the same light that impresses man’s
senses—is subject to the same conditions. The law
by which perception is awakened in the consciousness
is the same in the animal as in the man. But man
possesses also another element that is not content with
mere investigation, or mere observation of forms and
phenomena. You see this other nature is manifested
in the little child, after he begins to walk about and
observe the forms of things. There are certain things
he can not ascertain by the use of the physical senses,
and he asks his parents for further information. If you
will examine the philosophy of asking questions, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
will perceive that it is a means of gaining information
by the exercise of some faculties higher than the physical
senses. It is seeking for information that shall be
applied to the consciousness, that shall be represented
by ideas that exist in the mind. We may suppose that
Sir Isaac Newton and his dog were sitting in the
orchard, and that both saw an apple fall to the ground.
The dog could observe the fact as well as Sir Isaac
Newton, but Sir Isaac Newton perceived that there
was something involved in the fall of that apple, which
the dog never thought of. The dog confined his observation
to the mere fact; but Sir Isaac Newton perceived,
by the aid of a higher faculty, that there existed
a law which he wished to ascertain, and therefore commenced
investigation to discover it. This department
of mind which led Sir Isaac Newton to make this
investigation was not content with observing the mere
facts or phenomena of existence, but wished to investigate
that which was concerned in the production of
the phenomenon. That faculty gives rise in man to
this second sphere, which observes not the phenomena,
but investigates the law or proximate causes of phenomena,
and opens the field of science and philosophy.
Hence the second sphere of thought is that sphere which
investigates the relation of things and determines the
law of action and manifestation through that relation.
It belongs to what we call the relational, the middle,
or mediatorial sphere; because it embraces the means
by which causes operate to produce effects. For instance,
I speak and you hear. I am a cause of producing
a sound; your ears are affected by the sound
produced. The atmosphere is the medium by which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
the action is transmitted from my organs of speech to
those of hearing. The physical senses notice the fact
in the physical sphere; the intellectual perceptions
notice the means by which the fact is produced. The
next, the highest, the inmost, absolute nature is that
which perceives the absolute cause of these effects.</p>

<p>There is a sphere of mind in you that observes the
mere effect; there is a sphere that investigates the relation
or law by which phenomena are produced; there
is also a sphere of mind which searches after and perceives
the absolute cause of the phenomena. Now,
inasmuch as all being or existence must come under
one of these forms, either its phenomena, the means
by which they are produced, or the cause which,
through the means, has produced the phenomena, there
can be but these three departments of conscious perception:
the physical or intellectual, the moral or relational,
and the divine or absolute, which perceives
the absolute of all being. To illustrate the difference
between the relational and the absolute: When Sir
Isaac Newton discovered the existence of the law of
gravitation, and found it the same that caused the motion
of the planetary bodies, it was supposed that he
discovered the cause of their motion. He named that
law attraction, or attraction of gravitation. Now we
turn upon Sir Isaac Newton and ask, What is attraction
of gravitation? The only reply that can be made
is to speak of its effects. However intellectual the
mind may be, it must be ignorant of the absolute, because
it belongs to the sphere of relations. You can
not analyze the infinite. You can not compare the infinite.
It is only in the sphere of the finite that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
intellectual faculties have power to pursue their investigations.
That which perceives the absolute must
of itself be absolute; that is, the finite can not receive
the infinite—the finite can not embrace the infinite.
Therefore, if the infinite is ever to be represented to
man, there must be a department that is receptive of
the infinite; and that department must be infinite, or
it can not receive the infinite. When I dwell more particularly
upon this subject, I will endeavor to make it
apparent to you so far as language is capable of making
it.</p>

<p>Corresponding to the three spheres of perception
there are three spheres of affection. The first sphere
is called the sphere of self-love, or, to use a word
which would express it in every relation, I would call
it lust; that is, the desire for self-gratification. This
is the lowest sphere pertaining to the finite, and corresponding
to the sphere of fact or phenomena. The
second sphere is the sphere of relational love, and
that divides naturally into two departments—the love
of unconscious nature, the love of sciences, etc., and
the love of conscious being, or moral love, by which
man loves his neighbor, some conscious being out of
himself. That is the second sphere of love, known as
relational, and it belongs to the sphere of relational
truth, or the sphere of intellectual and moral investigation.
There is a third sphere of impulse or love,
known as the divine or absolute love, called the love
of God, the love of the infinite. In one of these three
spheres is every man’s ruling affection to be found—in
the sphere of self-love, seeking self-gratification; or in
the sphere of moral love, seeking the welfare of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
neighbor; or in the sphere of divine love, loving as God
loves, universally—not objectively, but subjectively,
all the wide universe. There can be but just these
three spheres. Now if each of you will investigate,
you will readily recognize two of the affections at
least to which I have called your attention, self-love,
and social love, but more particularly self-love, desire
for self-gratification, desiring that you may be first
mad happy, and then leaving the world to be happy
afterward. The love that goes out of itself, and loves
some being out of yourself, is exemplified in the love
of a true husband for his wife, of a parent for his
child, of a brother for a sister. All these loves give
indication of the second sphere of love, known as
charity, good-will to the neighbor. This love is the
means by which self-love is first overcome or destroyed.
The individual is brought from self-love,
through charity, to divine love, just as, in his knowledge,
he is brought from the sphere of fact, through
relation, to the absolute of being; and hence, in the
spheres of unfolding, the three degrees are necessarily
absolute. Look at society. What is it but the aggregate
of individuals composing it? Society, separate
from individuals, is nothing. The love of society is
only the love of the aggregate of individuals. Now, inasmuch
as the love will belong either to the sphere
of self-love, charity, or divine love, you will find that
society will always be expressive of one of these three
loves, never the third, though. We say of society,
when we look to the principles that govern it in its
administration, it is but the embodiment of the character
and will of those constituting the government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
—it is but an expression of the individuals composing
it. Therefore there are three spheres of government
corresponding to the three spheres of the individual.
For individuals living in the selfish nature,
the government will be a government of force. The
individual who has come out of this obeys the truth
because he loves the truth. He does not feel the
restraints of law that says, Thou shalt not steal, Thou
shalt not lie. He does not know that there are any
such laws in the State. He never felt any restraints.
That individual is not in the sphere of self-love; and
the government over him is not a government of force.
The government over him is a moral government, and
has its place in his affection.</p>

<p>Coming out of the government of force, man
comes into the second, the Christian, or government
of moral love, the government of charity. He then
comes under the “new commandment I give unto you,
that ye love one another.” This second, or mediatorial
sphere, is a moral one; hence this dispensation has
been called the mediatorial dispensation. Hence I
say there will be a second sphere of government, or
second dispensation, as it was called; but that dispensation
is only the magnification of the individual. It
is only the representation of society as one great individual.
Then there is a prophecy of the third and
perfect dispensation, which is called the millennial,
the divine dispensation. When the second shall have
performed its mediatorial work, when every individual
will have been perfected in his moral nature, and shall
be prepared to receive influx from the divine, then
will arise the third dispensation of government, known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
as the millennial. If we refer to the forms of expression
by which it is designated, we will find it spoken
of as taking place at the consummation of the age, at
the end of the world, when that mediatorial age is
through, when man is perfected in his moral nature,
has put down all rule and power; then Christ himself
becomes subject to the Father, and God, the Divine,
becomes all in all. That brings in the third dispensation,
the third sphere of government. These three
spheres of love in man lay the foundation for the
spheres exhibited in the Spirit-world. The governments
upon the earth, as well as in heaven, have their
basis in man. Man is but the footings-up of all past
ages; and the Spiritual worlds have their foundation
in him. Therefore, when you and I wish to study the
Spirit-spheres, to know what constitutes a sphere and
degree, we are not obliged to go out of ourselves and
look into space ten, fifteen, or a thousand miles away.
That is not the way to study the Spirit-world. The way
is to go within and study the spheres of Spiritual being
and affection. Individuals who are in either of these
spheres are allied to one of the three spheres in the
Spiritual world. The first is called the lowest, or dark
sphere, the sphere of outer darkness, sometimes called
the grave. The grave was called the place of darkness,
where there was neither knowledge, or device, or
wisdom, and was that to which allusion was made in
saying, that those in the graves shall hear the voice
of God, and shall live. It is sometimes called “Gehenna.”
It corresponds to man’s lustful nature, and
represents the darkness and impurity of man under
the influence of his lusts. That is what characterizes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
the first or lowest sphere of Spiritual being. The
second sphere corresponds to man’s intellectual or
moral nature. It is called “Paradise,” the place of
happiness. Jesus said to the thief on the cross, “To-day
shalt thou be with me in Paradise.” Two days
after, when Mary met him at the tomb, and offered to
embrace him, he said, “Touch me not, for I have not
yet ascended to my Father.”</p>

<p>He had been in Paradise—in the second sphere—and
he told them that when he ascended to his Father
they should see him no more. Both Gehenna and
Paradise are spheres of Spirit-manifestation. Those
who are charitable, and who do possess truly spiritual
natures or affections, are in alliance with Paradise.
Those in lust are in alliance with the sphere of lust or
Gehenna. Those who have passed through, and fulfilled
every impulse and every love in the second
sphere, are said then to be brought into the divine
presence. They no longer need a middle man between
them and the Divine, because the Father can then
speak directly to them. But so long as man is in the
sphere of outer darkness or in Paradise, there is between
him and the Divine (and he must approach by
a mediator) something that can take the things of the
Father and make them manifest to him in the visible
sense. But when man has come into the third sphere,
there is no longer a middle man; Christ himself becomes
subject to the Father, and God becomes all in all.
Then comes the New Dispensation, or the Consummation
of the Christian Age. The point to which I
wish to call your attention is, that the governments in
earth, as well as in heaven, all have their basis in man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
—man being but the footings-up of all the ages of
eternity. All is summed up in him; and he is the
footings-up of all that preceded him; hence all the
Spiritual spheres have their basis in man. Therefore,
when we wish to study the Spirit-spheres, we are not
obliged to go out of ourselves and begin to look off
into space ten, fifteen, or one thousand miles away.
The way is to come within, and ascertain the sphere
of Spiritual being, Spiritual perception and affection;
for all there is of the Spiritual universe is what has its
basis in the individual Spirits who constitute the
spheres.</p>

<p>As the societies of earth are composed of the individuals
of earth, so are the spheres of the heavens
composed of the individuals of the heavens, and the
ruling nature of the different spheres is but the aggregate
of the ruling loves of those composing those
spheres. The laws of the spheres are but the laws of
those composing the spheres. We are germinal universes.
We are to be developed and unfolded consciously
till the whole universe is translated into our
consciousness. There is but one way to study the
universe, and that is to come down into ourselves and
study ourselves. This idea of looking out of ourselves,
looking to any external method outside of our consciousness
to find out what constitutes a Spiritual
sphere or degree, is all fallacious. Spirits may come
and rap, talk, and preach till doomsday; if they can
not find the elements within your consciousness out of
which they can construct that Spiritual sphere, you
can not perceive or get any true idea of Spirit-spheres.
It is as though I were born blind, and had never seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
the light, and of course knew nothing of light, color,
and darkness, and some individual should endeavor to
make me believe that I was living in total darkness,
when there would be no part of my being to which he
could appeal to make me believe. There would be no
possibility of conveying the thought to my mind, because
I should have no conscious experience of light,
color, etc. Outward language could not give me the
idea. Unless I have had the conscious experience to
give me the idea out of which to construct the idea,
the Spirits from the Spirit-world may come from every
sphere and degree, and they can not convey to my
mind an accurate idea of those spheres and degrees.
If they would make me understand who God is, and
what he is, they must find in me the elements out of
which to construct that God. I say it is useless to
look for information out of yourselves until you know
what is in yourselves. The first lesson is to learn who
and what am I. I propose to commence my investigations
in each individual’s own consciousness, starting
with affirmations of that consciousness, and with definitions
about which we can not disagree, and then go
forward step by step, demonstrating every point, and
ascertaining the law of manifestation as that law is
revealed in us. I do not ask Spirits, and do not wish
them to come to tell me about the law that governs in
their sphere. The truth is, we can not avoid the fact,
that all communications that come understandingly,
must come in the method that God has ordained, and
that method is that it must be written by his law upon
our consciousness; and when it is written so, Spirits can
come and point out the writing to us; and that is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
best they can do. I desire you to understand distinctly
what will be the basis of my lectures, what will be the
points I shall attempt to establish. I shall endeavor
to prove Spiritualism. I shall not come to the raps
for a considerable time. They are so far off, I shall
not attempt to prove Spiritualism by rapping for some
time yet. People say we have got beyond the rapping.
The truth is, a large portion of the world have
not yet got to the raps. They are not yet able to appreciate
the raps. We must make considerable progress
before we can get the philosophy of the raps.
We have much to learn yet before we can get the full
benefit of a simple sound, even though it be not accompanied
by much intelligence. The first lesson I
shall attempt to teach—pardon me for assuming to be
a teacher, I will be a pupil at any time—is how to
study and know yourselves; how to ascertain the laws
of your being, action, and manifestation; how to determine
what is and what is not spiritual in you; how
to determine whether you are under Spirit-influence
or not—for there are laws by which all these things
can be determined. In my investigation I shall perhaps
be able to determine where that terrible creature,
Jack, the Giant-killer, the Odylic force, resides, and
show what it can and what it can not do. And I
promise, too, in the face and eyes of all theorizers who
believe that the Spiritual manifestations are traceable
to this force, and to the satisfaction of everybody else,
to demonstrate that it is not competent to produce
them. I will demonstrate it according to President
Mahan’s hypothesis. I will show by every known
law of nature that the power exerted at the brain’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
center, in a single instance he has given, was equal to
a thousand steam-engines of a million horse-power at
the distance of five feet from the brain. But that will
merely come in as collateral when I consider the objections
offered to our theory. I will endeavor to
consider every objection which any objector has proposed
to bring forward. I do not stand here to boast,
but what I speak is to me absolute. I stand here fearlessly,
and invite all classes of minds to raise any objection
they can to the Spiritual theory; and I bind
myself to answer them instanter, or confess my inability
to do so. The invitation commences now, and
extends to every moment I am in the city.</p>

<p>In my next lecture I shall begin with the question
of Spirit-spheres, and endeavor to unfold to the consciousness
of each of you the evidence of the existence
of a first sphere, from which you will all do well to escape;
and shall then proceed to prove the existence
of other spheres, namely, the second, or relational
sphere, and a third, or divine sphere. I invite skeptics
and atheists in particular to be particularly captious.</p>

<small>THE SPHERE OF LUST.</small></h2></div>


<p>Man possesses three natures—the animal or sensuous
nature, the intellectual and moral nature, and the divine
nature. Mind, in whatever department it is
manifested, possesses two qualities—perception and
affection, and understanding and love; or, when understanding
is united with true affection, wisdom and
love. I have heretofore said, that since man, in the
lowest department of his being, is animal in his character,
possessing the faculty of perceiving facts and
phenomena, that faculty was the perceptive part of his
animal being which embraces self-love, or a desire
after self-gratification. That portion of the mind which
pertains to the second part of man’s nature was described
as being that which investigates the laws and
relation of things, inquires into what relates to that
department of nature called the scientific, and studies
that which relates to man and society. What is called
the moral department of man’s being is that which relates
to the affectional part of his nature, and which is
called moral love or charity. That which pertains to
the divine or absolute of man’s being was said to embrace
the religious element in him; through which
department the Infinite, as the absolute of being and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
of affection, is to be revealed to the mind. The love
characterizing this department was described as divine
love—the love of the Divine Being. The first love is
objective in self, the second is objective in neighbor,
and the third is subjective in God. Thus, then, was
given the division of that department of mind pertaining
to man’s perception and affection.</p>

<p>I am now to commence with the first—man in the
lowest department of his perception and affection, to
show you its nature, and its presence in him, in society,
in government, and in the Spirit-world. If we
would learn the laws that govern in that sphere of the
Spirit-world called outer darkness, we need only learn
the laws that govern in the sphere of outer darkness
which is in man, and which is caused by man to exist
in society. A singular idea has obtained, that this
lower animal nature derives its quality from the physical
body we carry about with us; and that when we
come to be separated from it, we shall no longer possess
any of that nature; as though this earthly body
was the foundation of perception or affection—as
though the instrument were the cause—as though this
body, which we temporarily inhabit, exercised more
control over us than the mind!</p>

<p>I propose first, then, to inquire how much influence
the body exercises upon the mind, and how much influence
the mind exercises upon the body, so that we
may arrive at something like an accurate conclusion
as to what our condition will be beyond the grave; for
if we know how much is to be subtracted, at death,
from our animal natures, we can know how much of
that nature remains after we have passed beyond the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
influence of these material bodies. My first position
is this: The manifestation of impulse in finite beings
rises out of the relation which one finite being sustains
to another. There is no impulse that does not grow
out of this relation; and the impulse is according to
the nature and character of that relation. In the divine
order, if my body, as a physical and a finite existence,
did not sustain any relation, it would be subject
to no impulse; therefore, whenever I perceive an impulse
arising within me, I am informed thereby that I
sustain a certain relation to something, and that if I
would become truly wise in controlling that impulse,
I must learn what that relation is. I might begin
back of mind or conscious being to show how uniform
this law is in the material or unconscious world, as
that the influence between the earth and the sun arises
out of a certain relation existing between them, and
that if you change or destroy that relation, you change
or destroy that influence. But I will illustrate this
truth by reference to a conscious being. If man could
be isolated from all laws, he would be a very different
being from what he now is, although he might retain
the same constitution which he now possesses; because
he could not then come into certain relations
which are necessary, in order to have revealed within
him certain affections. I will take, for instance, the
conjugal relation. It is the nearest the Divine. It is
the first-begotten relation below the Infinite. Until a
man and woman come into the true conjugal relation,
they can not experience that love known as conjugal
love. Till then it can not be begotten in them. They
may conjecture they know what it is, but until that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
true relation is established between them, they can
never have an adequate conception of it—can never
know what it is to become so oblivious in another as
the true wife does in the husband, or the true husband
does in the wife; nor can they, like the true husband
and wife, experience that perfect harmony of soul, or
listen to that sweet spiritual music within, till they
have entered this relation, which alone can fit them
for a proper conjugal union. The law exists, and the
conditions exist; but man must place himself, and woman
must place herself, within the sphere of the law
and the conditions, or they can not experience the
benefit to be derived from them. So with the parental
relation. No woman can know what maternal love is
till she becomes a mother. Is it not so, mothers?
People may conjecture that they know what it is, and
suppose it to be a pure and friendly love-feeling existing
between mother and child; but they can have no
adequate conception of the deep tenderness and holiness
of maternal love—their idea of it does not begin
to reach down into the almost infinite depths of that
holy love. There is no possible way for an individual
to know what maternal love is, but to come into the
maternal relation. That is the way God reveals it in
the soul. The reason is, that the true maternal impulse
in the finite is the manifestation of the Divine
in the finite sphere, and this manifestation can only be
made in an individual when that individual comes
into the sphere where the Infinite can confer that
blessing. The same is true with reference to paternal,
fraternal, filial, and social love: they all depend for
their development upon those in whom they are man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>ifested
coming into the true relation which gives birth
to them.</p>

<p>The same law holds good when applied to the relations
existing between the body and the spirit. My
body can not be nourished so as to become an instrument
of individualizing in me an immortal spirit, unless
it be sustained by those things necessary to become
a part of its organism. I have needs, as an immortal
being, which must be supplied, or I perish; and since
those needs exist, they must have some means of manifesting
themselves to me; and one of the means employed
for that purpose is the feeling of hunger. A
desire for food proclaims a need of my wasting body.
The needed material can then be taken into it to build
it up and fit it for its holy mission of being an instrument
in elaborating an immortal spirit. So, likewise,
thirst is the voice of God proclaiming a need of my
body, and my spirit is induced to seek for that which
shall supply the demand of a divine impulse originating
in that plane. So it is in regard to all other needs
of the body calling upon the spirit for gratification.
The impulses, then, pertaining to this body have not
their origin in this body, but only in the relation which
this body sustains to my spirit; and when the spirit
has fulfilled its duty of supplying the needs of the
body, the demand ceases. When, being hungry, I
have appropriated the proper quantity of food, the desire
for food ceases. It is so respecting every other
need—when it is supplied, the demand ceases, and the
individual continues to be satisfied till the demand is
again created. By studying the needs of the body, and
making yourself acquainted with its condition as far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
as it relates to the spirit, you may learn exactly how
much influence, truly and properly, it exerts upon
your spirit; but when you look beyond the needs of
the body, and find impulses asking for more, you may
be certain that you are finding impulses which do not
pertain to your body. Though they may lay hold of
your body and stimulate it to action and administer
to its gratification, yet they do not arise out of it, but
out of some neglected need. Such impulses are the
voice of God calling our attention to some need which
you have forgotten or neglected, and they will not permit
you to rest till you discover what that need is and
supply it. I will illustrate this point.</p>

<p>Although man in the lower department of his nature
is animal, he is nevertheless something more than an
animal in the activities of his nature. The highest
impulse of the animal is to provide for and protect its
perishable mortal structure, and he has no immortal
spirit to provide for in the future. He is content when
the needs of the body are supplied. Did you never
notice how content and unconcerned are the horse and
dog when their demand for food is supplied? Young
animals and young children, in their play, are supplying
one of the needs of their body. But when the
children have passed from childhood, desires of that
kind cease, if they become properly developed men
and women, and others take their place; while the
animal, whenever the needs of his animal nature are
supplied, is satisfied. Consequently, you do not see
dissipated animals. Did you ever think of that?
Animals do not get drunk, nor seek for gratification in
any such unnatural channel. Animals are true to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
nature and to God. They can not have thoughts and
desires that pertain to the undying spirit, their highest
nature being merely animal. Were man as true to all
the needs of his being as is the animal to the needs of
his animal nature, he would not be the discontented,
unhappy, and lustful being he now is. But in consequence
of having to supply the needs of a higher
nature, he finds himself far from being as contented as
the brute, whose animal wants are all provided for.</p>

<p>There are spiritual needs pertaining to his understanding
and affections which are entirely overlooked
or neglected by him, whose demands are as imperative
as are the demands of the animal nature. The demands
of his intellectual and moral nature cause him to feel
the lack of something within which destroys his rest
and quiet. He seeks to satisfy this lack by gratifying
his sensuous appetites and passions. Thus man runs
into vice, and becomes sinful. Were it not for his
immortal thirsting for the water of life, he never
would be a wicked, lustful being; or if he would <i>supply</i>
the demands of that thirst, he never would be discontented
or lustful.</p>

<p>Now let us make the distinction between the lustful
and the divine impulse, that you may better understand
what I mean by the sphere to which I am calling your
attention. We all can tell the difference by appealing
to our own consciousness. The divine impulse informs
us of a need, and leads us to seek to supply it. The
Infinite only speaks of needs, and leads man to supply
them, that he may grow up into a perfect being.
Every impulse in man, from the lowest to the highest
nature, must be attended to, in order to render him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
perfect. The true impulse is one that promotes individual
happiness and contentment.</p>

<p>When the infant, in consequence of this impulse,
feels the sense of hunger calling for food, and such
food as its infantile nature requires, it cries; but the
supply of that demand is only necessary to cause it to
cease its crying. This is because the child is free from
those lusts which attach to persons advanced in years.
“Of such is the kingdom of heaven.” The child does
not lust after things that shall gratify or tickle its
palate; it only seeks for those things which it needs;
and when they are supplied, it ceases calling for more.
But with the advance of age it learns of lustful parents,
or by being acted upon by lustful influences, to seek
gratification through lust, while in its original unperverted
state it knows no impulses but those which
are natural, and, consequently, it obeys the true and
divine law.</p>

<p>Without stopping to inquire into the origin of lust,
I may say that it originates in man’s ignorance, necessarily.
If you recollect the figure in the parable of
the Garden of Eden, you remember that the sin committed
by Eve was eating of the tree of knowledge
of good and evil. That is where we all eat. But
I do not propose to dwell upon the nature and origin
of this lust in man, but merely to speak of it as
being that which characterizes him in his lowest sphere
of being. It brings him into antagonism with his
neighbor and God. It is that which begets in him so
much crime, and which brings ruin upon the world.
That is lust which leads him to seek after self-gratification
irrespective of any need, while the true impulse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
only leads him to seek to supply those things which
are <i>really</i> needed. The impulse belonging to the lower
sphere may be characterized as lust. The idea which
obtains so generally in society, that lust belongs only
to animal, sensual, or sexual desires, is, therefore,
erroneous.</p>

<p>Man may seek gratification in every plane of his
being; not only in what he eats and drinks, but also
in the intellectual plane. He may seek to gratify a
vain curiosity. When he feels restless, he goes off
searching after amusement. Time hangs heavy on his
soul. There is a perishing need calling for action, and
he knows not whence it comes, and he seeks to “kill”
this time by amusement or otherwise. This is lusting,
not in the animal sense, but in the intellectual sense.
He may also lust in the moral plane. What are called
friendships in the world, are distinguished by lusts.
You know how the world selects its friends: it selects
them according to the pleasure it expects to
derive from them. Is it not so? Does not the selfish
man and woman select friends with reference to the
enjoyment they expect to derive from their association
with them? And are they not most constant in their
attention to those who are most successful in administering
to their enjoyment? Look at this, each of you.
Look over the list of your friends, and tell me <i>really</i>
what is the basis of your friendship. You love your
friends, you say. Why do you love them? You love
to be with them. Why? You seek their society.
Why? Some of your friends you love best. Tell me
why it is that you love them best. You say they are
the most agreeable to you, and hence you love to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
with them. Is that the highest basis? If so, when
they cease to administer to your gratification, what
relation will you hold to them then? It is said that
“prosperity makes friends, and adversity tries them.”
They can make it pleasant for us when they are with
us, and in prosperity; but when adversity comes, their
position is not quite high enough for us; and we prefer
those differently conditioned. This remark is in accordance
with the statement, that the friendship of the
world is based upon the principle of gratifying ourselves.
In making your morning calls, you sometimes
visit your friends from a sense of duty; and are
influenced by the fear that they will find fault with you
if you follow your feelings in the matter, and go where
you will derive the greatest amount of pleasure.</p>

<p>When you think these friends are laboring to your
disadvantage, then your love for them soon cools off.
They don’t answer your purpose. Thus, trifling circumstances
make foes of friends. You may test the
friendship you think you have for individuals. If a
person’s friendship seems to be strong, and he can not
enjoy his friendship for another, unless in that other’s
society, and he desires to be in the presence of that
person, so that he can hear his voice and feel his personal
influence, and if, when separated from that friend
he is disquieted and unhappy, very much as is the person
who uses strong drink or tobacco, and is deprived
of his beer, or rum, or tobacco—his friendship has a
low basis. But if one has a true friendship, which is
high, and holy, and spiritual, one where his whole
confidence is merged in that friend, he trusts him with
his heart and most secret thoughts, and knows without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
doubt that he can not be betrayed by that friend; and
they hold constant spiritual communion with each other,
no matter how far apart—there is a concord of spiritual
communion between them that enables them to enjoy
each other’s society when separated by hundreds of
miles. True friendship is of the spiritual kind that
does not regard so gross and physical a friendship as
the friendship of the world. I wish to call your attention
to the presence of this impulse in you, because
perhaps you have not looked at the subject in this
light.</p>

<p>A word to husbands and wives. A young man,
when he contemplates getting married, thinks he will
get a wife that will make him very happy. One young
man thinks he would like a wife who will be economical;
another, one who would make a good housekeeper;
and another, an intellectual companion; so
they select not so much with reference to the wife, as
to the use of the wife. And ladies, on the other hand,
select husbands who they think will provide them a
good home, afford them protection, etc.; they want a
husband for his use; so the union between the man
and woman is often based upon the idea of use, and
not upon their fitness for companions; and hence their
love for each other continues so long as the use continues,
and no longer. If a man who desires a good
housekeeper finds that his wife is not one, or if a husband
finds his wife faulty in any other important particular,
just in proportion as she proves faulty his love
for her is abated; and at the end of twenty-eight days—the
period denominated the “<i>honey-moon</i>”—he finds
he does not love her near as well as he supposed; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
that what he supposed was love, was, after all, but a
desire after gratification—that he was loving self instead
of his wife.</p>

<p>Man may be lustful in his religion as well as in his
moral relations. He may mistake what he supposes to
be the love of God for the love of the use of God.
He expects God is going to make him eternally happy,
and bestow upon him unending enjoyment, and for
this reason he shouts and praises him, and calls it
loving God. He does not see that God is so much
better than anybody else; but he has become satisfied
that God means well, and will bless him; and he honors
him for these things. Hence his seeking after religion
that he may make himself happy and save himself
from suffering is as lustful and selfish as seeking
after something good to eat or drink, making self-gratification
the object of his search. The great difficulty,
my friends, with popular religion is, that it is
only a religious expression of lust. That it has not
beaten swords into plowshares and spears into pruning-hooks,
and taught people to learn war no more,
is because it has failed to adopt the means by which
the world can be made pure and happy. Hence the
religious man may be as selfish as the miserly man,
and yet think he is so much like God that he is going
to be saved. But it is not religion that he loves; it is
only the use of religion. Satisfy him that God is not
going to benefit him, but that he is going to damn
him, and he will curse him bravely. I ask everybody
to look at this.</p>

<p>It is claimed, as I have already remarked, that the
impulse of lust belongs to the body, and does not grow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
out of the relation which the mind sustains to the
body. What need, I ask, did Alexander’s body feel,
which demanded that he should have all the kings and
potentates of earth on their knees before him? What
did he want of the wealth of the earth? and what
made him weep because there was not another world
to conquer? Was it his body? I tell you, Nay; there
were perishing needs within him that would not give
him rest till they were supplied; and, ignorant of the
nature of those needs, he sought to supply them by
the gratification of his selfish nature. Not heeding
the voice of God, he took his sword and rushed upon
mankind, and made that the balm for the healing of
his restless spirit; and when he had conquered the
world, and had it at his command, he was more miserable
than before; simply because he had entered
farther into the broad road leading to destruction and
death. He felt the bitter agony of soul consequent
upon a departure from the straight and narrow path.
This lust was not the lust of his body—it was the lust
of the spirit. It was a desire for self-gratification
that arose, because the needs existing in consequence
of neglecting the demands of the spirit were not supplied.
He sought gratification in a way in which he
thought he could obtain it; but he was sadly disappointed
in the result.</p>

<p>The miser, in every age, has been trying to obtain
happiness by getting gold. A French miser, who,
like a great mass of mankind, thought wealth would
make him happy, sought for it, and was so successful
as to obtain it. He possessed his untold millions, and
yet desired more; and he found that the more he pos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>sessed
the more he desired. He also perceived that
his wealth did not gratify his wants. The moment he
possessed it, he found he could not take care of it to
his liking. He could not trust it in banks, for the
banks might break; and he did not like to invest it in
stocks, for stocks were liable to depreciate in value; so
he made up his mind that he would convert it into
money, and keep it continually in his sight; and accordingly
he had it placed in heaps, and stood and
watched it. But then he was unable to sleep because
he feared burglars and assassins, whose plottings for
his life and money constantly rung in his ear. As he
stood and watched those shining heaps, he reflected
that although he had obtained wealth he had derived
no satisfaction from it, but that every dollar added
to his possessions added a new pang to his sorrows;
and he determined to kill himself, and accordingly
proceeded to the banks of the river Seine, for the
purpose of drowning himself. Upon arriving at the
river’s bank, happening to put his hand in his pocket,
he found four guineas. Thinking they would thereafter
be of no use to him, he concluded that rather
than have them lost, he would, before he sought his
watery grave, go and find some needy person to whom
he might give the money. He accordingly went to a
miserable hovel close by. As he approached it, he
heard cries of agony and distress within. He entered,
when he beheld a most heart-rending sight. There
lay a poor, sick, distressed widow on a pallet of straw,
with a few rags for covering; and there were four
hungry, dirty, naked children crying for bread, while
the sick mother had no bread for them, or the means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
of obtaining any. The miser stepped up to the bed,
and placed the four strayed guineas in her hand, and
told her they were hers. She looked wildly at the
money, and then at the giver, and then at the guineas
again. She seized his hand, pressed it, blessed him,
and called upon God to bless him; and the children
thanked him. The thanks, and blessings, and tears
which were showered upon that miser’s heart caused it
to break, and for the first time in his life a pulsation
of pleasure, delight, and satisfaction beat through
his soul, and as he stood and witnessed the joy, and
thankfulness, and hope of that family he exclaimed,
“What! is happiness so cheap? then I will be happy.”
Then he went away, not to drown himself in the
Seine, but to seek out other similar cases of suffering;
and after that he had no occasion to kill himself, for
he had found what was the canker that had so long
been gnawing upon his heart. He found that he possessed
a moral nature that had needs, and that that
nature was calling upon him to perform certain moral
duties; and that the moment he obeyed the demands
of that nature, he silenced that clamoring within,
which had all his life long rendered him unhappy
and discontented; and at a good old age he testified
that the way to be happy was to be good and useful.</p>

<p>I think his experience will be yours and mine. We
talk about wanting pleasure, and we seek it in amusements
and at theaters, routs, and balls; and I tell you
that this feeling arises from the same cause as the
miser’s misery. We have hungerings and thirstings of
soul which we are required to satisfy, and except we
comply with these requirements we will be disquieted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
If those of you who love the opera, the theater, etc.,
will go forth and tread these streets, and find out the
objects of need—those worthy of aid—and visit them,
and administer to their comfort, you will no longer
feel the need of theaters, routs, and balls; and you will
find greater satisfaction in such a course than these
amusements can afford. Try the experiment, and I
will guarantee you will be successful. That this city,
like all great cities, is pursuing after pleasure, as the
paramount object to be attained, is because their souls
are hungering and thirsting after that food necessary
to build them up into the stature of perfect men and
women. This makes time seem cruel, and hang heavy
upon them; and, like the victim who seeks to drown
his sorrow in the cup, they seek to fill up the long hours
in dissipation. To return to my subject.</p>

<p>This sphere of lust, I say, then, does not arise from
the body, nor from the influence of the body on the
soul. It arises from our neglect of our spiritual needs.
This lust, this desire proclaims a divine life within,
which demands activity corresponding to our real
natures; and we can never get peace and happiness
until those real demands of our natures are supplied.
I appeal to all pleasure-seekers whether this
is not true. You have heard it argued whether there
be more pleasure in anticipation than in participation.
The world’s pleasures are always in the future,
never in the present. The man or the woman of the
world is never satisfied with present conditions or
present attainments. Why not? Because the man
and the woman of the world are not attending to the
present needs of the spiritual nature. The finite man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
ought to understand that he lives only in the present.
God the Infinite only belongs to the future. Man’s
needs pertain to to-day. His physical, moral, and intellectual
needs are all bearing upon the present, and
not the future. The past is his schoolmaster, to teach
him how to be ready to enjoy the future. It is to-day
that we should take thought for; hence the divine saying
of the man of Nazareth—“Take no thought for
the morrow. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.”
If we look to the present, and supply the needs
of the present, the future will take care of itself. The
man seeking for religion thinks he wants it for the
future, in order that he may die right; but a man does
not want religion to die by. There will be no trouble
about his dying if he only lives right. I do not care
for religion for the sake of having it to die by. Only
give me its living benefits, and you are welcome to its
dying benefits. This shows the false estimate the world
sets upon religion.</p>

<p>I desire to impress upon your minds this principle,
that when you look down to the real basis of selfishness
and lust, you will find that they do not originate
in the body, but that they pertain to the spiritual
being. There are certain needs, however, which do
grow out of the physical body; but when the spirit is
separated from the body, it no longer feels these physical
demands; for instance, it will no longer feel the
need of food, experience thirst, or be susceptible to the
effects of the elements—heat and cold—as is the physical
nature; but that which administers to the demands
of the mind, independent of the body, belongs to the
mind. And when you enter the Spirit world, if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
take truth with you, you will also take falsehood—if
you carry purity with you, so you will impurity—if
justice goes with you to that sphere, so will injustice.
Now think of society in its individual action, social,
governmental, and religious action, and tell me
whether the world, or the individuals of the world,
are governed by the true, divine impulse? Are they
searching after the true needs of the body and mind,
or after pleasure and self-gratification? And in your
activity, which controls?—a sense of need, or a desire
after gratification? You settle this question for yourselves,
and I will settle it for myself. If you are under
the rule, and in the sphere, of lust you belong to the
sphere of outer darkness; and if you are under the rule
of charity, you belong to the second sphere or Spiritual
Paradise. His servants you are to whom you yield
yourselves servants to obey. It is for you to say whom
you will obey.</p>

<p>Now this earthly sphere is the lowest and darkest
sphere. Its influences are dark and defiling. In this
sphere men are swallowed up in worldly matters, and
striving to gratify self.</p>

<p>But when a separation takes place between the mind
and the body, we shall come into new relations, although
we shall not at once change our thoughts, feelings,
and affections, and shall recognize ourselves.
Our lusts and self-love will follow us to the Spirit-world.
There is not, as many seem to suppose, a
miraculous process, by which man is changed while
passing through the dark valley of shadows. If a
change takes place in him in the Spirit-world, it must
be in accordance with the same divine law which governs
him in this sphere of existence. If you will but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
exercise your reasoning faculties on this point, you will
see that it should and must be so. When we come to
understand the Spirit-world, we shall find that in our
Father’s house there is a mansion suited to those who
seek after self-gratification, and that that world, like
this, is subdivided into many minor spheres, corresponding
to the various grades of development in the
different spheres of mind. There are physical spheres,
intellectual spheres, moral spheres, and religious
spheres, as there are in this world; and they are very
much of the some description as those here, because
they proceed from the same basis. Individuals passing
from this sphere to that, will fashion out of the materials
which their own conscious elements furnish the
same kind of a Deity there that they worshiped here.
As in New York city there are many degrees of advancement
in these different departments—one man
seeking to gratify his lusts through appetite, and
another man in some other way; and as you can find
here every sphere, except the divine sphere (I doubt
whether you can find that), so in the Spiritual world
you will find all these different degrees of advancement,
each occupying its own appropriate sphere.</p>

<p>Here is one man who seeks gratification, it may be,
in strong drink, and he worships the bowl; another
seeks it in food, and hence becomes an epicure, and
worships the stomach; another, it may be, seeks gratification
in practicing certain games or tricks, or following
after some amusement; while another seeks
gratification in sexual indulgences. So you may go
on and enumerate the endless variety of channels in
which men seek to gratify their selfish desires; and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
will be found that those in the same pursuit affinitize
with one another—drunkards with drunkards, etc.—every
sphere delighting in that which corresponds to
the desires of those who compose it. So in the Spirit-world;
the Spirit who was a drunkard here seeks gratification
in the same direction that he did on earth;
the seeker of pleasure there still has a love for the
theater, routs, and balls; the libertine still delights in
miserable songs he was accustomed to hear.</p>

<p>Governments, institutions, and associations and relations,
whether social, spiritual, or otherwise, are
expressions of what are the loves and delights of
the soul of man. Therefore, in all institutions, you
will find displayed the characters of those who founded
them. The government of any country is but the
child of the ruling mind or minds of that country.
Then, if we wish to understand the dark spheres in the
Spiritual world, we have only to drop the body and
have our spiritual eyes opened, when we will see that
there exist there all the phases of society that we find
here. The cause of this arises from the sphere of
lust. You have there your gambling Spirits, your
drinking Spirits, your lustful Spirits, etc. And how
do these poor creatures live there? That is the next
question. What do they do to gratify their desires?
I will tell you. You understand it to be a psychological
principle, that when two men are brought into
sympathy, or into <i>rapport</i> with each other (one being
positive and the other negative), feelings, sensations,
and desires can be communicated from one to the
other. To give an illustration: You have seen, in
mesmerism, an exhibition of mind separated from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
influences of the body. When the mind is thus separated,
and this mesmeric sympathy is established between
the subject and the operator, any surgical
operation can be performed upon the subject without
giving him pain, because his being of sensation is removed
from his body; but you can not pull the hair
of the operator, or hurt his finger, or otherwise give
him pain, without giving pain to the subject. Whatever
the operator enjoys or suffers, the subject also
enjoys and suffers. Now it is in accordance with this
principle that Spirits of the other world gratify their
desires. Spirits who visit this world are obliged to
make use of and come into <i>rapport</i> with, those who
have appetites and desires similar to their own. If
the mind is separated from its own body, it can experience
the sensations of another body with which it
may come into <i>rapport</i>. On the same principle a good
mind, or, if you please, the Divine Mind, can flow
into the individual mind, and impart thought and
sensation to that mind. Or a good Spirit can flow
into a medium, and awaken sensations and thoughts
in accordance with the law of action and re-action, becoming
negative or positive, according as he wishes to
impart or receive influence. Here, then, is the means
by which the Spirit is enabled to gratify its desires by
visiting earth. Those Spirits who allow themselves to
be influenced by their lusts are called tempting Spirits,
and they influence individuals on earth that they
may make use of them as a means of gratifying these
lusts. The same law is manifested by individuals in
the body. It is not because Spirits wish to injure the
bodies which they thus use, but because they desire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
self-gratification, and know of no other means of obtaining
it, except in this sphere of outer darkness.
The lowest in this scale of unfolding corresponds to
this lustful nature in man. Every affection in society
that can affect societies of men has its representative
in the individual man; so that every subdivision of the
sphere of lust has its representative in each individual;
and the question is whether he lives in one of these
departments or another. If I am developed in the
moral department, there I live, and love, and worship;
and when I pass to the Spirit-world, I go to a sphere
corresponding to that ruling affection by which I am
controlled. So it is in regard to any other sphere of
unfolding, whether it be relational or absolute, or otherwise.
Hence man himself determines his sphere.
Take any man or woman you please, and let them be
developed to any sphere, from the darkest sphere of
lust to the purest sphere of love, and if there is any
place in God’s universe where they can find that which
corresponds to that lust or love, they will find it. If
there is any condition suited to make them happy,
they will find it. If this were not so, the Spirit-world
would be the worst hell imaginable. To compel a man
to go where he has no affinity would be to inflict upon
him one of the greatest punishments conceivable. Compel
a lustful libertine to remain in a Methodist class-meeting,
and shout and sing with the enthusiastic
Methodists, and he would be extremely miserable—he
could find many places where he would be infinitely
more happy; and in order to be happy, he would be
obliged to go where he could find that which would
correspond to his cast of mind. We can determine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
where a man’s God is when we ascertain what it is to
which he will sacrifice every thing else.</p>

<p>After having thus given the law governing this lowest
sphere of the Spirit-world, which represents man
in his undeveloped nature as an intellectual and moral
being—we are qualified to comprehend that sphere,
and understand that the same spheres of mind which
belong to this belong also to the Spiritual world, and
that undeveloped Spirits from that lust-sphere visit
earth, or societies of earth, not for the purpose of redeeming
them, but for the purpose of seeking their
own gratification. I have presented to you my views
of that sphere as I understand it, and I shall be prepared,
in my next lecture, to take up the second
sphere, and tell you what constitutes it, and how
it is that it becomes a mediatorial sphere—middle
sphere. This second, or Spiritual sphere, is between
the dark and light, or divine sphere. It is the means
through which the lustful are brought out of their lusts
to the divine.</p>

<small>THE SECOND, OR RELATIONAL SPHERE.</small></h2></div>


<p>The subject now to be considered is that of the
second sphere of mind, both in its perceptions and
affections. Our last discourse was upon what we denominated
the first sphere, which was characterized as
being a sphere of self-love or lusting after self-gratification.
The individual in this sphere was described
as being in the lowest department of his mind, and as
allied in his affinities with the lowest pleasures of existence.
It was remarked that this plane of lust could
be manifested as well in the intellectual, moral, and
religious plane, as in the animal or physical plane.
The criterion by which we determine whether it is
selfishness is to inquire whether the motive prompting
to activity has for its object desire after gain. If
this is the ruling impulse, then the individual’s love is
the love of self. Though the grossness of the lust may
depend upon the direction given it, yet it is essentially
the same whether exercised in the moral, intellectual,
or physical plane. An individual who sought the
happiness of another without reference to his own interests
was described as belonging to the second sphere.
He would seek association by the affinity of his moral
or second-sphere nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>We meet with individuals in society who affirm that
man is essentially selfish—that he can not conceive a
wish which does not originate in a desire for self-gain.
I have no doubt that the individuals making that
affirmation are very honest in it, and speak from their
own conscious experience. There are many such to
be found in society, who know no higher love than
self-love, and their highest benevolence is based upon
selfishness. I doubt not that there are those who
entertain such sentiments, but I utterly protest when
such men attempt to speak for the Race. I will allow
every person to speak for himself upon this point, and
to ascertain if there are not some actions which have
not this lustful basis; and when we find that there are
such actions arising within ourselves which are not
contaminated with this selfish thought, and which go
forth to seek expression out of ourselves, we may know
that they do not belong to the first, but to the second
sphere of action, I mean the sphere of relation, as separate
from the individual considered in his individual
love or individual selfish impulse. I will give a few
illustrations of this kind.</p>

<p>Every individual coming under the divine impulses
of the sphere of relation—I mean relation in its divine
order—and living in forgetfulness of separate self, will
experience some of the impulses which belong to that
sphere. When the mother comes into the maternal
relation and experiences the love of a mother for her
child, she is ready to sacrifice the comforts and interests
of self for the welfare of that object that sustains
that near and dear relation to her. I speak of the maternal
love as a representative of that love for another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
which is divorced from its lustful or selfish character—not
based upon considerations of self-gain. We may
desire the salvation of individuals on our own account,
for our own enjoyment, and also from a love divorced
from all considerations of self, which stands out holy,
pure, and undefiled for a being outside of itself. The
mother, in loving her child, experiences happiness;
and as she presses it to her bosom, and imprints upon
its delicate cheek the maternal kiss, there is joy deep
and unutterable awakened in that mother’s bosom; but
she does not kiss the child that she may have the joy.
It is not her joy and happiness that she seeks, but the
comfort, happiness, and welfare of the child; and in
thus supplying that demand of her maternal nature,
she feels the influx of the divine nature, saying, “Well
done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful
over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many
things: enter into the joy of thy God.” That is what
God says to every mother who loves her babe from the
true maternal feeling. So is it in the true relation between
husband and wife. I mean now the union in
heaven, and not the union fixed up by society and its
institutions—I speak of such hearts as God has joined
together. When the true husband meets the true wife
and surrenders all his manhood to the care and keeping
of that wife, in full confidence and trust that she
will receive it and not abuse it; and when the wife in
return gives all her womanhood to the care and fidelity
of the trusting husband—when two such souls surrender
each to each the other’s self, loving from an interior
and divine harmony, then the joys of conjugal
love are awakened, the true demands of each soul are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
supplied in the experience of those joys which can be
found alone in that relation, and God speaks saying,
“Well done,” and breathes his divine blessing upon
them. So it is in the fraternal relation. Where from
the natural, constitutional harmony of soul existing
between brothers, each being individualized upon a
common moral plane, and loving the other with a pure
and undefiled love, their love belongs to the second
sphere.</p>

<p>Where the individual loves his neighbor as himself,
he would as soon sacrifice his own interest as that of
his neighbor, and would as soon be unjust to himself,
nay, sooner be unjust to himself, than to his neighbor.
He loves that neighbor with a pure heart, loves him
as a manifestation of his divine Father’s Love, Will,
and Wisdom, and seeks to harmonize his own being
with him in all his relations. He can not see a brother,
however weak, crushed, without seeing himself crushed
in that brother. When he loves a brother with that
pure, unselfish love—when the common heart of humanity
abides in his breast, he comes into the true
plane of charity; for charity is that which seeketh not
her own. The motive that prompts him is not self-gain.
It is the desire to do good unto others that actuates
him. The quality of charity is to suffer long, not to
be envious, not to be easily provoked, not to be puffed
up, or behave itself unseemly; but in all things to be
true and faithful, and kind to everybody. The man or
woman possessed of this love, whose whole being and
activity is directed in the sphere of relation to man, to
society, to the world, belongs to what I call the second
sphere, and gives evidence that he or she has risen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
above the lustful plane which seeketh its own, and
which loves to gratify its passion, desires, and appetites,
in one form or another, and that he or she is
loving in harmony with God, and wills and acts in accordance
with the divine impulses.</p>

<p>Look abroad into society, look at the love of the
world, and see how many there are who love their
neighbor with an unselfish love—how many are so
careful to be exactly just with their neighbor as they
are careful to have their neighbor be exactly just to
them. There are many who watch the scale to see if
it preponderates in their favor; and if the merchant
gives good weight, they speak well of him; but if he
does not give good weight, they are very ready to speak
ill of him. When you come to see how much better
they love to have justice done to them than they love
to do justice to others, you have an indication that
the lustful nature is somewhat alive and active in their
breast. The individual who is conscious that his desire
is earnestly to be just, will be as careful not to do
an injustice to his neighbor as he would be cautious to
avoid an injury to himself—will no sooner circulate
defamatory remarks against his neighbor than he would
defame himself. When you find an individual thus
acting, you may be certain that he has risen from the
first plane and is entering the second. But I am sorry
to say that in the vast majority of cases you will find
lust lamentably present. I called your attention to
this in my last lecture, showing you how it was manifested
in almost every sphere of life, even in performing
the duties of a father, brother, husband, or wife.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
In the majority of cases man and society are loved for
their uses.</p>

<p>When it is desired to ascertain whether we belong to
the first or the second sphere—to the sphere of Gehenna
or Paradise—we need only to determine the
quality of the affection that rules in us, to see whether
it be looking mainly to our own gain, or whether we
rise above self and go out to seek the well-being of
man. We sometimes mistake, thinking that we love a
man himself, when we love his influence or society,
because by it we think we can be elevated in our social
condition. We ought, therefore, to be careful in
trying ourselves to know to which plane of affection
we belong, lest some of these considerations outside
of the individual influence us, lest that we mistake for
love that which, proved by the true standard, will appear
to be selfishness and lust.</p>

<p>When one possesses a love for the well-being of all,
he is willing to contribute liberally and freely of his
strength and talent for the redemption of all, and has
an unwillingness to be found at any time as the representative
of that idea which would tend to degrade or
crush any human being. There is no being so low in
the scale of humanity as to be beneath his efforts to
raise him up; and if the tyrant should stand upon the
neck of the weak, his impulse is to push that tyrant
off and break away the captive’s chains, because he
can not see his brother fettered without feeling fettered
himself—can not see the humblest human being outlawed
without seeing all humanity insulted. The individual
who has not seen enough of the dignity of the
nature of humanity to fulfill the duty he owes to uni<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>versal
humanity, has not yet come to the true plane
of charity, is not qualified to occupy a high position in
this second sphere.</p>

<p>I might illustrate in a variety of ways how it is that
man apologizes to himself for being selfish. Here is a
constitution, and there a law, and there a public sentiment
demanding that a human being should be
crushed; and he turns his back to humanity and God
and bows to the Constitution. Such a man has not the
love of humanity in his bosom; he loves that which is
respectable and strong, and which may be of service
to him under particular circumstances. But the individual
who can be a Judas and can sell the Lord in
the shape of his brother—can betray him with a kiss
and sell him for thirty pieces of silver, whatever may
be his profession—belongs to the lowest grade of humanity.
Here is a truth that every soul must affirm.
It honors the man that honors humanity, and despises
the man that despises humanity.</p>

<p>When a man in his lustful nature will bring his
whole soul to honor that sentiment, he is prepared to
leave the first and enter the second sphere, which is
expressive of the finite character of man as he comes
into this charitable affection. This character in man
is that which determines the second sphere in the world
of Spirits. Man is a universe; and if there is a hell
in the universe, it is because it is in man; and if there
is a heaven, it is because there is a heaven in man.
Those who are developed only in the sphere of outer
darkness, and who from affinity love to associate together,
will be found composing what is called the
Outward Sphere. Do not now, by any means, asso<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>ciate
the idea of sphere with that of place. The persons
in this room are all together, so far as space is
concerned, but so far as sentiment or sphere is concerned
you may be at heaven-wide distances. While
one is in <i>rapport</i> with celestial affections, holding communion
with the Divine Father, the other may be in
<i>rapport</i> with Spiritual beings, holding a communion
with the angels; and a third may be in <i>rapport</i> with
the infernal, holding communion with the spheres of
lust. It is not a question of place, but simply a question
of condition. If you and I are in the condition
of lust in our affections and perceptions, if we associate
with others in the same condition, heart thrills to heart,
just as in the moral or divine sphere heart answers
to heart. Each in his own plane seeks that which is
adapted to his own nature. I say, therefore, do not
connect the idea of place with that of sphere.</p>

<p>Man is a little universe—a microcosm. This sphere
of lust is within him, from which the dark sphere of
the Spiritual world is developed. Those who are in
the sphere of lust on the earth respond to the inhabitants
of this dark sphere of the Spiritual world. So
also in the Spiritual spheres is the development of
man’s relational love. Man in fulfilling his relational
duties lays the foundation of the Spiritual Paradise.
Thus man rises and dwells in different spheres according
to the development of his affections. If we love our
neighbor as such, and seek after the redemption of
man on his own account, we become allied to that band
of guardian angels whose mission it is to watch over
him and to stimulate in him impulses to resist that
which is evil and impure. We become guardian angels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
and every effort we put forth for the redemption of
our fellow-man elevates our own souls. Hence the
remark of the poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Heart thrills to heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Throughout the wide domain of heavenly life;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each angel forms a chain which in God’s throne begins,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And winds down to the lowest plane of earthly minds;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And only as each lifts his lower friend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can each into superior joys ascend.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We are told that we must seek our salvation. That
is bad advice. He that seeketh to save his life shall
lose it. It is this very seeking to save ourselves that
damns us and the race. It is the very selfish desire
for salvation which allies us to the sphere of lust. The
true spirit is to seek to save our fellow-man; and as
we can not save him except by adapting our ideas
to his needs, we must, as instruments to his salvation,
put away our lust. That effort will result in our own
salvation. There is but one way to save ourselves, and
that is by fitting ourselves as the instruments for the
redemption of the world. Laboring to redeem our outcast
and down-trodden brother and sister is the very
best kind of labor to elevate ourselves, since it exercises
in us the true love for our fellow-men. Thus it
appears that it is more blessed to give than to receive.</p>

<p>I may go out into the streets some cold morning,
and seeing a beggar, stop and debate with myself
whether he is worthy or not; or for fear that I may
refuse the right one, I may drop a sixpence in his
hand. From such an act I will not receive a blessing.
But if I (in forgetfulness of considerations of that
kind, from the overflowings of a loving heart, from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
sincere desire to do good to a fellow-man who is
in need) give him alms, it is laying up treasure in
heaven. I have placed it at my Father’s disposal—have
intrusted it to one of his messengers.</p>

<p>We have a fashionable way of doing charities in
this world. We do not like to be troubled with charities.
We are willing to be taxed some—we are very
generous to give sometimes; but then we do not want
the trouble of finding the object, and bestowing it
with that love, kindness, and sympathy of soul which
carries more joy to the stricken heart than the poor
pittance. He needs it as much as he does your other
charities. But instead of taking this trouble, we raise
contributions, appoint a committee, and go and drop
our gifts by machinery here and there. If you will
look up a poor sufferer some of these cold mornings,
and give but a dime, with a blessing, you will not only
carry joy into the heart of the suffering poor, but rejoicing
into the Angel-spheres. In that way you must
cast your bread upon the water, and you will find it
after many days—will hear, eternally you will hear,
the music of that poor sufferer’s thankful heart. If
you once in purity of soul, in the pure affection of
your heart, go and bestow a kindness from a pure and
fervent spirit, you will awaken a chord which will vibrate
harmoniously in your soul to all eternity.</p>

<p>As man develops in himself a love of his fellow-man
irrespective of exterior relation, but as a child of
God, as possessing in his bosom the germ of immortality,
and as endowed with a facility of eternal unfolding
in the eternal future, he comes into the sphere
of true charity; and when his work is faithfully done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
here, he will enter upon that reward which he has been
laying up in heaven, where neither moth nor rust corrupts,
and where thieves do not break through and
steal.</p>

<p>There is between the first and second spheres, speaking
of them in the affectional sense, another sphere,
called the intellectual sphere. Man as an intellectual
being has loves or delights. The quality of the intellect,
you are aware, is to investigate, to think. Intellect
of itself has no affection, no sympathy. It can
be allied with vice or virtue. It can attend the missionary
in his labor or the pirate in his murderous work.
It has of itself no conscience, no moral quality.
Hence you will find that men may be highly intellectual
and vicious or virtuous. Intellect can join upon
vice or crime, and upon charity and virtue, and that,
too, without experiencing antagonism from such union.
Man may be developed intellectually without affecting
particularly his moral character. Intellect’s particular
mission is to investigate that which addresses the perception.
It can join upon the sphere of lust or the
sphere of charity. Were it not for this, the selfish and
charitable natures could not unite in man, and there
would be such an antagonism in the individual, he
could not be possibly developed from the plane of his
lustful nature to the plane of his moral nature. Intellect
is a sort of John Baptist that goes between the
Moses and the Christ of man’s nature. It does not
partake of the lust of Moses nor of the love of Christ.
Its delights are sometimes mistaken for love, or the
joys of love. People often say of things which are
beautiful that they love them. They say that they <i>love</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
the study of mathematics. That expression seems to
me to be improper. The heat of love is never known
to the cold intellect. The intellect can discourse eloquently
respecting justice and right; but, so far as the
heart is concerned, it may trample upon all justice.
You will see men who, so far as theory is concerned,
will discourse eloquently concerning human justice
and morality, yet they utterly disregard and ignore all
moral restraints in their private character and practices.
These men are babes in their moral natures—they
are less than babes. Intellect has to do with the
relations of things—pertains to dead matter. The difference
between intellect and morals is the difference
between the essence and spirit of matter and the
essences or spirit of the soul. While science, which
belongs to the province of intellect, may harmoniously
journey with the moral affections, it may also journey
with the sensuous affections. I make these remarks so
that you may not suppose that a man belongs to the
second sphere because of his having an intellectual
character.</p>

<p>The second sphere is a finite one, and depends entirely
upon relation for its development, so that you
can see at once that man could not love in the second
sphere of his being without some object to call that
love forth. The relational love, in this respect, is not
like the divine love which goes forth independent of
any object. The first sphere is objective in self; the
second sphere is objective in neighbor; and the third
sphere is subjective in God.</p>

<p>The difference between this second sphere or love of
the neighbor and the third sphere or the love of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
absolute in this: The second sphere of love is objective,
is not self-existent and self-sufficient; it depends
upon having an object to call it forth. The constitution
of mind is such that, in its consciousness, it can
not love an object without having perceived it, the
perception being either an ideal one or a real one.
The love in point of quality depends, for its perfectness,
upon the perfectness of the object. Not so with
the infinite and divine love which is self-existent and
self-sufficient. Wherever it acts, it acts subjectively,
not objectively, though it is objective in its manifestation.
Said Jesus of Nazareth, who was deeply
learned in this love, in speaking to the Jew who was
to become his disciple: “Ye have heard it said by those
of old time, Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
thine enemy; but I say unto you, Love your enemies,
bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate
you, and pray for them that despitefully use you; that
you may be the children of your Father which is in
heaven; for he causeth his sun to shine upon the evil
and the good, and he sendeth his rain upon the just and
unjust.” Notice the figure. The sun shines not objectively.
It shines of its own nature. If the earth were
to be blotted out of existence, the sun would shine on
still; and if every other planet in the solar system
should refuse to receive its light, the sun would continue
to shine. Its light and heat go forth in their own
plenitude. Therefore if you and I wish the sunlight,
we have but to stand forth; but the sun does not shine
or send forth his heat because we are here. It does
not shine objectively but subjectively upon us. The
sun, as a type of the divine wisdom, continuously gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
forth its light; and as a type of divine love it constantly
gives forth heat to build up finite forms.</p>

<p>The Divine Father does not stop to inquire, whether
men love him or not. His love is self-existent, self-sufficient,
and goes forth of its own divine plenitude,
of its own infinite fulness, blessing every being in
every plane, according as he comes into the condition
to receive that blessing. God’s sun shines upon the
field of the wicked man as quick as upon the field of
the righteous. This is bestowing blessing upon a common
plane. Man loves friend and curses foe, but
Christ says you must not make any difference. You
must become like your Father. You claim to be his
children; therefore love your enemies, seek good for
all, whatever may be their affection for you. Christ’s
doctrine differed very much from what the world had
heard before. It had generally been supposed that
God loved objectively. Christ taught that God blessed
every man according to the plane he occupied. God
of his infinite fulness will pour out all the blessings
you are capable of receiving. If you want all the
joys of the third heaven, which are inexpressible,
bring your mind to love subjectively. Love God, not
for his use, not because he is going to bless you, but
because there is interior harmony and oneness between
your soul and his—because your heart thrills and
throbs to his divine heart. Then you will reap the
blessings belonging to the divine plane. Man can
only love an object by having an object to love; but
God is love; it is his nature to love and bless; and
whatever comes within the divine influence will be
blessed according to its capacity to receive the bless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>ing;
and every action, every impulse, and every going
forth of the divine in every plane is but a manifestation
of that divine love; so that when you and I have
perfected ourselves in loving our neighbor, have fulfilled
the entire law of charity to all mankind, we are
yet to go into a higher and holier love than that. We
are to arise above this discrimination—we are to come
into a plane where, having received the divine life and
love, they shall go forth by their own plentitude to
bless all around us, as our Father blesses all. In other
words, he is to sit as a refiner and purifier of silver,
and he is to purify us from all this dross, until he sees
his own image perfectly reflected in us. When we
shall reflect the divine image, there will be an indication
that all dross is burned away, and we shall be
swallowed up in the divine will, though still retaining
our divine personality, our hearts beating with the
great heart that beats throughout the universe.</p>

<small>COMMUNICATION.</small></h2></div>


<p>Communication proper belongs to the sphere of manifestation,
and signifies, as I use the term, the imparting
by one, and the receiving by another, of that which
is imparted, or that which represents that which is
imparted. When we look at man as a finite being,
born as he is without conscious knowledge, and without
conscious affection, and developed from that negative
point by that which flows or enters into his consciousness
and daguerreotypes itself there, we readily
see that he can only develop by being subject to the
principles of communication: that is, he must receive
that which is without into his consciousness; therefore
it must be communicated to him. Hence it becomes
necessary for us to understand somewhat the laws of
communication. As communication belongs to the
sphere of manifestation, or the sphere of the finite, we
must examine and see what are the means by which
man as a conscious being is addressed, and the law by
which the influence exerted upon him is governed.</p>

<p>The mind when looked at in its simplest nature consists
of its perceptions and its affections: that is, its
knowledge, if you please, and its love; but in the
order of unfolding, perception, as a conscious principle,
precedes affection. That is, an individual as a finite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
being can not love till he perceives an object to call
forth that love or affection. Whether it pertain to unconscious
or to conscious nature, he must perceive the
object before the affection is known to exist in his consciousness.
For instance, a husband can know nothing
of conjugal love, neither can the wife, until the
object calling it forth exists in his or her perceptions.
Neither can the mother love her babe until the object
exists in her perceptions. Neither can the brother
love brother or sister, or the child love its parents,
until they perceive the objects of their affection. So
you understand what I mean when I say in all finite
natures perception precedes affection as a conscious
principle; hence the law of communication pertains
to perception and affection. As perception precedes
affection, it is more external, view it in what sphere
you will. I am now using perception in the sense of
thought. The individual, by the means of communication,
may be addressed externally by first addressing
his perceptions, and thence through his perceptions addressing
his affections; or he may be addressed by
first addressing his affections, and through them his
thoughts. I shall use for the purpose of convenience
the expression thought and affection.</p>

<p>Then the two methods by which individuals may be
addressed are first the external, and second the internal.
The external communication flows first into
the thought, and the internal first into the affection.
The external proceeds from thought to affection, and
the internal from affection to thought. The one is by
an outward language, by signs, and symbols, and rep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>resentatives
of ideas; the other is without external language,
and is what is known as inspiration.</p>

<p>Now, as there are three planes of conscious being,
conscious perception, and conscious affection, and as
the thought or perception precedes the affection in the
first or lowest plane, so it is in the second; and it is
the perception and affection in the third that begets
the affection in the divine sphere. But as I am speaking
of communication I am confining my remarks to
the first two spheres—the external physical sphere,
and the spiritual or relational sphere; for they are
spheres of manifestation and communication, and have
reference to these finite spheres. When I complete
the consideration of these, I will make some remarks
on the divine sphere, to show the difference between
it and those spheres below the divine. Take man,
then, as a mere animal being, looking at his nature as
being nervous, where his perceptions and affections
have respect to his physical being. Here the same
law of order prevails—perception precedes affection,
and perception is external, while affection or love is
internal; but taken both together as constituting the
animal nature, it becomes external to his spiritual nature;
but in his spiritual nature perception precedes
affection; hence, if we would communicate with him
spiritually, external language communicates first with
thought, and thence with the affection; while internal
language communicates first with the affection and
thence with thought. Then external and internal communication
differ in this, that the external is by means
of outward language, and the internal is by means
of a sort of inspiration. There are inspirations per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>taining
to each of the three spheres—the nerve-sphere,
the spirit-sphere, and the divine-sphere. On coming
into <i>rapport</i> with this audience, I through the nerve-medium
by external means perceive individuals about
me—perceive their forms, their faces, and their relative
positions to each other; that is, by an external medium
which represents the individual through the
nerve-medium to my consciousness. But I may come
internally into <i>rapport</i> with these individuals by bringing
my nerve-system into harmony with their nerve-system,
and becoming negative to them. To explain:
when I bring my nerve-system into sympathy with
you, I take your sensations upon myself. If you have
a pain in your head, I have a pain in my head also,
corresponding in location and character to yours; or
if you experience a pain in any other part of your
body, I feel that pain. Not a word has passed between
us concerning it, but nevertheless it comes upon
me, and affects me in precisely the same manner that
it does you. Now this I consider analogous to the inspiration
which belongs to the higher plane. This is
the inspiration of the nerve-sympathy. Permit me to
explain briefly what I understand by harmony; because
the great law of harmony is fundamental to a
comprehension of the law of inspiration.</p>

<p>You are aware that if we take two strings of equal
length and tension, and vibrate one of them, its vibration
communicates its motion to the atmosphere, and
through the atmosphere to the adjoining string, so
that they at length vibrate together. This experiment
may be made by any one; and it will be found that
in this manner they can be caused to give forth the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
same sound, because the length of the vibrations of
each will be the same; and when there is a difference
in the tone, it will be found that there is a difference
in the length of the vibrations. This fact can be demonstrated
by varying the vibrations—by tightening
or loosening the strings, and thus shortening or lengthening
the vibrations, when it will be perceived that
the shorter the vibration the higher will be the pitch
or tone. The length of vibration, then, determines the
question of harmony. Here appears the great law of
harmony in musical sound throughout the universe,
which is commensurability. In mathematics, things
which will mutually measure each other are said to be
commensurable. Now these spheres of atmospheric
vibration will always produce concord or harmony of
sound. The difference between a third and a fifth is
in the difference in the tone, and the difference in tone
depends, as already said, upon the length of vibration.
The sweetest harmony is the apparent discord, where
the vibrations do not chord, but where every fifth coincides;
and in this way produces the harmony of the
third and fifth. The octave produces it by being repeated
twice, so that after all the real octave is as the
square of the octave; that is, the octave multiplied into
itself; and you arrive mathematically at the law of
harmony by following out that principle. The point
to which I wish to call your attention is, that what
constitutes harmony is simply commensurability in
the atmospheric undulations.</p>

<p>Now my nerve-fluid moves by pulsatory movements,
as move all other media, and these movements sustain
to those of your nerve-fluid commensurable or incom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>mensurable
relations; and you will find that the law of
musical harmony, by which one of two strings having
the same tension communicates its motion to the other,
is the law which determines the harmony between my
nerve-system and yours. I am constituted to speak
upon a certain key, like an instrument. My nerve-vibrations
undulate to that key, and when I am in
perfect health, there is perfect harmony in my system.
Your nerve-undulations are perhaps tuned on a different
key, and if you are positive to me, my nerve-undulation
will not move yours, nor yours mine, but
they will resist each other like two strings unequally
tuned. So my nerve-vibration will not communicate
its undulations to you, nor will yours communicate its
undulations to me, unless we happen to be upon the
same key, or in harmonic or commensurable relations
with one another. But in order to get our nerve-systems
to undulate one upon the other, I must either
become negative to you or you must become negative
to me. If I relax the key of my nerve-vibration, I
shall change them until my nerve-system undulates in
harmony with your nerve-system; and I being negative
and you positive, you undulate to my key, and we
get nerve-sensations between us without any sign. The
individual in mesmerizing his subject becomes positive,
and he will succeed in mesmerizing that subject just
as soon as he brings about a harmony of nerve-vibration,
so that the nerve-vibrations of both are alike.
The condition is that the operator places himself in a
positive position, while the subject must become negative,
by allowing his nerves to become relaxed; then
the operator commences by a strong effort to undulate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
so to speak, his nerve-influence or forces upon the
medium, until the medium sinking down comes to his
key; and then he by his forces insulates the system,
and the individual passes rapidly into the condition of
mesmerism; but do any thing to disturb that medium,
so as to make the points of nerve-tension unyielding,
and the operator may work till doomsday in vain. It
is not till the points have yielded and the vibrations
harmonize with his that he can produce the effect upon
the medium. This is on the same principle with the
phenomena exhibited in experiments with the string,
which is a type of the law of communication in every
sphere—the vibration of the string represents the entire
law.</p>

<p>Take one string whose points of tension are unyielding,
and another whose points of tension are yielding;
then cause one of them to undulate, and it will impart
its motion to the atmosphere, when the atmosphere
will strike upon the other; and if it have the same
points of tension that the other has, it will undulate;
but if it have not the same tension, it will receive the
influence of the atmosphere, the tendency of which
will be to depress it and bring it to its own vibration;
thus eventually the two strings will be made to harmonize.
So when we sit down to mesmerize a person,
he may be so positive that we do not at first succeed,
perhaps, in producing the least impression upon him.
We try again and again, and at last succeed in controlling
the nerve-system, and through that the mental
system of the subject. We are each time we try reducing
the nerve-system to our key or standard, and
the moment it is reduced to that point, the subject is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
under the operator’s control, and not till then. When
I speak of the harmonic action of one system upon
another, it will be perceived that I speak of the
relative measure or length of the nerve-undulation
which passes between one mind and another. In the
nerve-plane there is this method of addressing the
nervous perceptions by external means—by language,
by signs, by pantomimic representations. And there
is the internal method corresponding to inspiration,
which consists in coming into nervous sympathy and
receiving nervous sensations one from another. A
sensitive person looking upon a wound shrinks from
beholding the sight, and there are real sensations experienced
in his nervous system which have been produced,
not because a nerve-influence has acted upon
him, but because he has seen the wound. The impression
first fell upon his conscious perceptions, and then
went to his feelings, which is analogous to the principle
that the idea first comes into the thought, and
thence reaches the feelings.</p>

<p>In the second plane—the mental or Spiritual plane—the
same law prevails. There is the external method
of addressing the mind, and there is also an internal
method. The external is the method by which the
mind is addressed first through the thought, and the
internal is that by which the mind is addressed through
the feelings. These two methods obtain in the whole
plane of manifestation. If I wish to communicate
with you, I must adopt one of these two methods; and
if I am not in spiritual or nervous <i>rapport</i> with you,
I must adopt one of the methods of external communication,
and address you by signs or outward represent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>ations—addressing
first the thought or understanding,
and coming thence to the affection indirectly. In all
external methods, as well as in internal methods,
media of communication become necessary. In speaking
to you it becomes necessary that there should be
some external media between you and me, and my
communication must be through that media. In the
present case, my speaking to you is performed through
the physical atmosphere. I undulate my organs of
speech to produce sound, and the atmosphere connects
them with your organs of hearing, so that my mind,
through my organs of speech, is connected with your
mind. The method of communication is to transmit
the actions of my organs of speech to your organs of
hearing. Without this external medium I could not
communicate with you by an external language.</p>

<p>Were I to address, not the ear, but the eye, there
must be between us an external medium which addresses
the eye; and that medium is the light which
takes up the image of that which I would represent,
and transmits it to your consciousness through the eye.
So also in respect to the nerve-medium. If I would
communicate an impression through the nerve-medium,
there must be that medium external to me which corresponds
to the action of the nerve-fluid in you and
me—there must be a medium between us which takes
up my action and transmits it to you, and makes it
your action. So with the mental medium. If I am to
stand here, and you are to come into <i>rapport</i> with me,
and I am to impress my thoughts upon you without
external language, there must be a medium corresponding
to these thoughts, and that medium must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
come down from me to you; and while I have power
to awaken its vibration, its vibration must have power
to awaken the same impression in you. Hence, then,
in respect to all communication, there must necessarily
be media connecting one with the other, who are all
concerned in making and receiving the communication;
and the medium must be such that it will extend
from the one to the other. It must be continuous also;
for if there be any interruption in the media, the communication
can not be transmitted. For illustration,
if I would address your consciousness through sound,
the atmosphere, as the medium, must be continuous
between you and me; for if you interpose a vacuum,
you can not transmit the action through it, the connection
being destroyed. So in regard to light. Interpose
any medium which will not allow the light to pass
through it, and I can not transmit the image by means
of light. So also the nerve-medium must be continuous,
in order to admit of transmitting communication
through it. The mental medium must likewise be continuous,
or I can not represent my thought through it.
You perceive, then, this universal law in respect to
communication between one mind and another, that
there must necessarily intervene a medium, which
must be continuous between them, and it must be such
as to awaken action in the one, and transmit and
awaken the same action in the other. It matters not
what the plane is. They all come under the same law.</p>

<p>Before I, by my simple will-power, can transmit a
thought or idea or impression of my mind to you, there
must be something between us which can take up and
repeat that idea, or record it in your consciousness. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
there be anything to interrupt this medium, I can not
transmit that thought; so that any power whatever
which can interrupt that medium can interrupt the
communication. Hence, again, it appears that in all
communication between one being and another, there
must necessarily interpose a medium, which must be
continuous from the communicator to the one receiving
the communication. This brings us to the consideration
of other conditions necessary for communication
between two minds—the difference between the thing,
the being, or the existence itself, and that by which it
is made known to the mind. I stand here before you.
You can see me. I am then present in each one of
your minds. I am present by my form, as well as by
the sound of my voice. How many of me are there
here? One, of course. How many do you see?
How many of my mental images are here? Just as
many as there are eyes to look. My image is that by
which you see me. My image is not in your mind in
reality; it is represented in your mind by something
proceeding from me to you. My form is multiplied
and repeated wherever there is an eye to see the
image which proceeds from this form. If there are
two or three hundred persons present, I have two or
three hundred spiritual forms; and if there were ten
thousand present, I should have ten thousand spiritual
forms. There is a difference, then, between the form
itself and that which represents the form, and you
should make this distinction. You may take as many
positions as there are mathematical points in this
room, and place an eye in each, and my form will be
represented in all of these points. The means, then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
by which you, through the eye, become conscious of
my presence here, is omnipresent in this room. I am
not omnipresent, but that which represents me is omnipresent,
and that by which mind becomes conscious
of me is omnipresent.</p>

<p>There is never any existence to the mind in the
sphere of manifestation, except by representation. We
talk as though we saw the sun, moon, and stars, and
not as though we saw their representations; but in regard
to all things external or manifestational, man in
all forms only perceives the representation; and when
the representation corresponds to the reality, he has
the truth. Now in looking at these lights, the light is
not in your mind, but its representation is there. It
is there by that which represents it. Then you must
make a distinction between the omnipresence of being
and of that which represents being. In respect to all
means by which the mind perceives existence external
to its consciousness, it is true that it only perceives it
by representation, and not by its presence. Existence
in every department is represented to your mind, and
mind by its representation, and not by its absolute
presence, perceives it. Understand this distinction,
and it will explain a great many mysteries you have
had to contend with in times past. As you perceive
my form by that which represents it to you, and as that
which represents it is omnipresent in this room, while
my form, from which these representations flow, has
but one position, so also, if you should remove these
walls many feet, or even miles, making this room
many miles in extent, my form would be omnipresent
in all this space, and the mind that perceived me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
would perceive me by that representation of form, and
not by my presence.</p>

<p>Now then, understanding this law, we will be very
careful in all our investigations of communication to
distinguish between the presence of the thing itself
and the presence of that which represents it. Did I
wish to communicate with a Spirit, who has unfolded
in him a Spirit-consciousness, which can be addressed
in another way than through the physical eye or ear
or touch, and being so divested of this physical form
that my mind comes in absolute contact with this
Spirit-medium which permeates all space, and which
internally and spiritually corresponds to light external
and physical, and passes freely through bodies
opaque to light—then my Spirit-form acts upon
that Spirit-medium which is not impeded by this wall,
but which passes through it as light through transparent
glass, carrying my image with it. We say that
glass is transparent, because light passes freely through
it, and brings the image of that which it would represent.
We see an individual or tree coming freely
through the glass into the room. Now if we have a
medium which will pass as freely through a board,
then that board is as transparent to that medium as
glass is to light. The magnetic medium, by which the
magnetic needle is influenced, passes freely through a
board even; therefore to that medium the board is as
transparent as glass is to light. It is also well to understand
that this nerve-medium, as well as the spiritual
medium corresponding to the mind—which is to
the mind what the medium of light is to the eye—passes
freely through these opaque bodies. Therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
the individual brought in contact with this medium
will see Spirit-existences, not by their presence in the
consciousness, but by that which represents the presence
there. Hence it is that the clairvoyant (when
you have proceeded with your manipulation until you
have insulated the mind, or brought it into clear <i>rapport</i>
with this spiritual medium or atmosphere so that
he sees by the spiritual sight and hears with the spiritual
ear, and no longer sees with the physical eye, or
hears with the physical ear) comes in contact with this
spiritual medium, and can look out into another room,
and tell what is transpiring, who is there, etc., just as
we can look through glass and tell what we see. The
principle is precisely the same. The medium by which
he perceives things in another room freely permeates
or passes through the intervening walls; so that although
my spiritual form is still in this body, yet it is
actually exerting its influence on this spiritual medium
throughout the world—throughout not only this world,
but throughout the solar system. Wherever this spiritual
medium extends, this spiritual image of mine is
taken and carried out through that medium, just as
my physical image is carried out through the medium
of light; and whoever comes into <i>rapport</i> with that
Spirit-medium and influence, and undulates to the
same motion, will perceive that form. Hence coming
into the clairvoyant condition I may see a person in
London, if it so happen that the undulation of my
mind on this medium be such as to harmonize with
that of the individual in London—not that his spirit
is personally here present, or my spirit personally
present there (but I am here in my own spirit-con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>sciousness,
and he there in his spirit-consciousness),
but because his image as well as mine is here and there
and everywhere else. The idea that my mind goes to
London, or his comes here, is altogether a misconception.
I perceive that individual in London, not by his
absolute presence, but by that which represents that
presence here; just as I see you, not by your presence
in my mind, but by that which represents your presence
there. It is in this way that persons in the body are
at times seen as though in distant places; that is, they
are seen by that spiritual image which is present,
where the mind is unfolded so as to perceive by the
spiritual medium, and happens to be in <i>rapport</i> so as
to undulate to the same motion with that of the mind
of the individual it perceives.</p>

<p>Standing here this evening, I may be seen in Philadelphia,
because my image is there, as well as in every
other place on earth; and the individual, let him be
where he may, who happens to be in <i>rapport</i> with me,
will perceive me as though I were present where he is,
and all the imagery by which I am surrounded. I am
looking on this congregation, and therefore the person
seeing me, sees me surrounded by this congregation.
He does not see you, but since you are in my
mind, your image goes with mine. The person coming
into <i>rapport</i> with me, sees you as your image exists
in my mind. The idea that persons whose external
forms are in different places, communicate with each
other by being present one with the other, is altogether
a mistaken one. So far as the external or relational is
concerned—so far as the finite or manifestational is
concerned—we communicate externally only by that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
medium which represents that which we investigate or
perceive; and that is the peculiarity of arriving at
knowledge through what is called the sphere of manifestation.
The difference between being and manifestation
is seen in that law.</p>

<p>If any one doubts this law, I am ready to be questioned.
Bring up any case you please, either from the
natural or the Spiritual world, and I will show that
that is the law. I say it is altogether a fallacious idea
that Spirits can not communicate without being actually
present—the idea that Spirits can not communicate in
New York, London, Liverpool, or any other place in
the world at the same moment, is altogether a fallacious
idea. They can be present wherever there is a
mind in <i>rapport</i> with them to see that presence.
People talk about their being so rapid in their passage
from here to Boston or London, and wonder how they
can go over the ground so quick. This is all explained
when you understand the law of manifestation. There
is no apparent difference of time between London and
any other place—it is only a relative difference—merely
a question of relation. This, then, being the
law of communication and manifestation, we will just
notice one thing further, which will explain why it is
that individuals are obliged to come into certain states
to receive communications, and will answer many
other questions, among which are, “Why are not all
mediums?” “Why can not all get communications?”
“Why is it that one who can get a communication at
one time can not at another?” Ten thousand such
questions are pressed every day, when the law is just
as simple as that two and two make four.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>If we wish to get a communication we must conform
to the conditions required by the law; and if we do not
conform to those conditions, God himself could not
give it to us. The laws of manifestation and communication
are as fixed and immutable as God’s own
being. Our business is to comply with the conditions,
and then take what follows. We need not stop to
quarrel because it requires a wire rather than a tow-string
to make a good telegraph. It is enough for us
to know that it is so, and conform to the conditions.</p>

<p>The great law by which all action producing result,
producing development and communication, is governed,
is the one to which I first referred—the law of
commensurability in form and motion. All development
comes under that law. The law of triunes, the
law of sevens, and the law of twelves, are all wrought
out by that simple law. You can not develop in any
key except you comply with that law. Commensurability
tends to produce harmonious results, while incommensurability
tends to produce discord and death—the
difference between concord and discord marks
the difference between commensurability and incommensurability
in form and motion.</p>

<p>We have several different departments of our systems,
I have a vital, a nervous, and a mental system,
each of which has actions peculiar to itself—actions
which sustain to each other certain relations, either
commensurable or incommensurable. Now, when my
spiritual and vital systems act upon the same key,
there is harmony between my internal and external
forms; but if they do not undulate to the same key—if
there is not harmonious action between my mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
and spirit, I can not be a medium for physical communication,
for the same reason that if you graft a
peach upon an apple, you can not make it grow (according
to my information). It is because the vital
action between them is an incommensurable action.
Now, whenever my mental action is too intense for my
nerve or vital action, if you will by any means reduce
my mental action so that it may harmonize with my
nervous action, perhaps I will get physical manifestations
peculiar to myself. I was once one of those
things called mediums, and am now, perhaps, to some
extent. When I was partially asleep there would be
very loud raps, and if you could come in without
waking me up you might get a communication, and it
has ever been so when I am peculiarly quiet mentally;
but the moment I rouse up and ask questions I can get
no reply. There are others who require exactly opposite
conditions, whose bodies are too active for their
minds, in whose presence you can get rappings by reducing
the action of the body. But you change them
from that point, the manifestation ceases. There are
other individuals who in the normal state seem to comply
with all the conditions necessary; that is, whose
vital and nervous actions are the same; but you make
them angry or stir up within them feelings of dread or
fear, and your manifestations cease, simply because
there is no harmonic action between the mental and
physical systems.</p>

<p>Persons boast, at times, of being able to destroy the
power of mediums; but nothing could be simpler, for
a powerful battery may have its action stopped by lifting
out the connecting wire, simply by disarranging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
the conditions of its action. It is often the case that
the entrance of a person into a circle where manifestations
are occurring, causes their discontinuance, and
the person is perhaps astonished to think the Spirits
should be so contrary. It was simply because he had
come in and violated the conditions by which they
could manifest. He had, so to speak, disturbed one
of the plates of the battery. The law to which your
attention is called, is this great law of commensurability
in form and motion; or, in other words, the
law of harmonic action, which is manifested not only
in the material plane, but unfolded in every degree
upon the conscious plane. In consequence of this law
the communication between spheres differing in their
characteristics must necessarily be external; that is,
I can not communicate with an individual by the internal
method, or the method of inspiration, except he
is on the same plane with myself. Perhaps there is
not one individual here so exactly on the same nerve-plane
with myself, that I could communicate with him
without signs; yet I can reveal my form so that you
can all see me, by an external method, though we belong,
perhaps, to very different planes. We can all
communicate by external language, provided in our
communications, we take that plane of communication
which will be familiar to all present. This is the law
existing between minds out of the physical body. One
mind out of the physical body may communicate with
another out of the physical body, by an external
means, when he can not by the internal. The external
means does not come directly to the affection. The
vulgar and the profane man may speak to the refined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
mind by means of speech so as to shock the feelings;
but he can not speak by his sympathy.</p>

<p>One class of individuals in the sphere of lust—in
what we call the low and polluted plane—can not
come into <i>rapport</i> with those occupying a higher plane.
There is an “impassable gulf” between them. Nevertheless,
by the external language which addresses the
external being, the thought or perception, they may be
able to communicate. The same law of communication
applies in the Spiritual world. If angels are employed
as messengers, they communicate by an external
language; because their thoughts can not flow into
the lower affection—the lower can not respond to
them. If a Spirit in Paradise wishes to communicate
with one in the sphere of lust, he must take upon himself
the conditions of lust, or he can not communicate
by the internal method. He can not communicate
by the internal method, because the conditions are
dissimilar. Communications made to us from a higher
plane must be external, and must be addressed to our
thought; and if they operate upon our affection, must
flow from the thought into the affection. It is for
this reason that God, the Divine, can not communicate
with man, the imperfect and finite, except by
means of those who can receive truth from the Divine,
and who can externally communicate it to those below.</p>

<p>Spirits under a higher and more perfect law can
not come and inspire us in our polluted condition,
but they can, by means of external language, draw us
from our low condition of lust, and bring us to a plane
where a Spirit nearer to our plane may by influx<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
come into us and develop within us the true affection;
but the high spirit can not do it. Hence it is that
there is a gradation between the highest and lowest—that</p>

<p>“Angels form a chain which in God’s burning throne
begins,
And winds down to the lowest plane of earthly things.”</p>

<p>I may possibly receive a communication from a
higher plane by abstracting myself from the lusts and
evils of the world, by sending forth my highest, and
holiest, and purest aspirations after all that is pure and
good—for a moment elevating my condition to a higher
plane. That is the condition of true prayer. While
in that condition a Spirit of that higher plane may, by
influx, raise me up and hold me in that condition.
That is, the true effect of the condition known as
prayer, is to separate you from the lusts and passions
of the world—every thing which is tending to degrade
you. Then by fixing your mind on your highest perception,
and that which is pure, and true, and holy, you
elevate yourself above the plane on which you naturally
move—bring yourself where a higher angel can
reach down and raise you up. Therefore, though
prayer does not change the state of the soul, yet it is
one of the conditions by which we climb to the higher
spheres. You know the direction in regard to prayer
was, “when you pray do not go into the public places
and talk a great deal, thinking God is going to hear
you for your much speaking.”</p>

<p>The object of prayer is not to inform God—to change
his mind—therefore when you pray, retire from the
world and all outward influences, and if necessary go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
into a room, and shut the world out with all its influences;
and then, in the secret aspirations of your soul,
raise your thoughts and desires to the infinite, perfect,
and undying, that you may bring yourself within the
plane of blessing—within the plane of that influence
which can elevate you. If God could come down to
our plane, and by the influx of his Spirit into our consciousness
could enlighten our understandings and
purify our hearts, there is no excuse for its not being
done. He is infinite, and there is an infinite fullness
in him; but the reason he does not, is that he can not.
It is impossible that God should lie, and it would be
lying if he should do this.</p>

<p>Conditions can not be at the same time unlike and
like—at the same time discordant and harmonious;
the plane of lust can not harmonize with the plane of
love. The plane of man in his low condition can not
harmonize with the plane of the Divine in his infinitely
elevated, pure, and holy condition. Therefore if a man
would receive God into his consciousness, he must put
himself into the condition to receive influx; and if he
would have an influx from a pure Spirit, he must become
pure and holy himself. If God did not teach
Moses so that he could understand all truth, as did the
Man of Nazareth, and understand the great principle,
“Thou shalt not resist evil by evil,” it was because he
did not occupy the plane of inspiration. He occupied
a plane where there could be external manifestations,
which he had, but he could not receive a great universal
law, because he was not on the plane of the internal
and divine. The inspiration of Paul, Peter,
Luke, and John, was not equal to that of their Teacher,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
because they had not arisen to his elevated condition;
had they occupied his plane, God could have communicated
as well to them as to their Teacher; and it
would not have been necessary for them to have a
middle-man to come between them and God.</p>

<p>When you have risen to the plane of communication,
the communication is internal. You have no
outward form of expression, because you have the
thought itself by inspiration. In the language of the
Apostle, God writes his language in your understanding
and in your affections. All communication with
the spiritual world proceeding according to this law,
each man’s communication will be according to his
plane; if in the low plane of lust, his communications
will be of that character; if in the plane of love, his
communications will be of that character. But even
the lowest, by putting himself in the condition of
prayer, by aspiring for the good and the holy, by
putting up earnest petitions for aid, will always find a
Spirit near to sustain and elevate him.</p>

<small>PHILOSOPHY OF PROGRESSION.</small></h2></div>


<p>If we wish to arrive at an accurate knowledge of
any subject, we must endeavor to ascertain what is
fundamental to that subject. If we need to investigate
accurately any science, we need to inform ourselves as
early as possible of the fundamental principles pertaining
to that science. There is no better way to study
the history of creation than by studying it as revealed
in the phenomena of Nature. When I can investigate
Nature in her operations, and ascertain the laws by
which she performs her work, I then can arrive—at
least approximately—at the philosophy of Nature, in
attaining which I attain the philosophy of divine manifestation.
There can be no interpolation there. The
Divine Artificer works alone in the fields of Nature,
and where I can discover the manifestation of wisdom
and power, there I come directly into communication
with the Divine Being in that plane of action and
manifestation; and when I learn what the law of
action and manifestation is in that department, I learn
so much of the method of the divine work, or of the
divine order. I propose, then, briefly to call your
attention to the teachings of God upon this subject of
progression, as manifested in the fields of Nature; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
will then ask you to accompany me in endeavoring to
ascertain what are some of its fundamental laws.</p>

<p>Were I to inquire what is the apparent design of
everything we behold, we must see that it is pointing
to the ultimating of an individualized, immortal, intelligent
being, who should be capable of understanding
all truth, and being perfected in every true affection.
Everything tends to bring about that great result—the
unfolding of an immortal being. God and the material
universe seem to be laboring to beget an individualized
being in the image of both God and the universe—God
as the absolute and infinite, and matter as
the finite, uniting, produce a being which partakes
of both the absolute or infinite and the finite. When
viewed from one plane he is infinite; when viewed
from another plane he is finite; so that between God
and matter man is mediate. I would say, then, in
simple language, God is the father of the spirit, and
matter the mother of his form. The first step in the
path of unfolding, as taught by Nature, is that of individualizing
form. The next step is that of individualizing
life, of producing individuality. The last step is
that of producing personality, making the individual a
personal being. The form is necessarily finite. The
mind can conceive of it only as finite, and as composed
of that which is the absolute, finite matter, which, separate
from the divine being, has no life or power. It
is not self-sufficient nor conscious.</p>

<p>If we can suppose that matter shall be divested from
all connection with media which can impress upon it a
condition, we speak of it as being amorphous matter,
or matter without form. If we unite it then with one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
medium, as electricity, we find it tending to produce
the gaseous condition, the nebular condition. Form
is not yet attained. If we unite with it still another
medium which is a little different from electricity,
forms of the mineral kingdom are produced. We
have here the first degree of form, but as yet there is
not life or individuality. Now the next advance is to
induce in that form a condition which shall make it
receptive of life, for that which is to be individualized
is life. So, then, in passing through the elaborating
influences of the mineral kingdom, it arrives at a certain
point, a sort of culminating point, where it joins
upon the vegetable kingdom; and the line between
these kingdoms is passed by such imperceptible gradations—so
slow in the unfolding of forms—that it is impossible
for the naturalist to tell accurately where the
one begins and where the other ends; but the vegetable
kingdom is manifestly begun when there is found
the incorporation of a new principle into a new form—a
principle looking to organization—giving matter an
organic structure. When the principle known as the
life-force is introduced, then it is understood that mineral
has passed and the vegetable is commenced. As
soon as this is unfolded, we have a second advance of
form—life in its first degree; or, in other words, individualization
commences. Form has passed to its second
degree, and goes on elaborating degree after
degree, producing diverse organic forms, until it is
prepared to receive another and a more interior
principle—consciousness—until by imperceptible degrees
we arrive at the animal kingdom. We have then the
animal form, the third or finishing degree of form, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
the second degree of life, and the first degree of consciousness.
Man in his animal nature is the completion;
of the highest form. Life has yet one more
degree to pass through; consciousness has yet two
more degrees to pass through before it is complete.
The next advance is to a higher principle of consciousness—to
a more enduring principle of life, without
changing the material form, and that is to the spiritual
degree of unfolding.</p>

<p>Looking to the highest types of the animal and the
lowest types of men, we will observe that they approach
very near to each other. Naturalists have been
divided in opinion as to whether or not man was an
animal projected on a little higher plane, and whether
or not the difference is not merely one of degree. I
say that when man is developed, we find him developing
or individualizing a higher principle. Individuality
was first started in the vegetable; the principle of
vitality in the animal. The second degree of individuality
was where the animal became individualized on
a higher plane of life, on a plane of consciousness belonging
to what we call the nerve-medium. Man individualizes
upon the second degree of consciousness and
the third degree of life, completing an individuality.
He becomes to us the highest type of form and life in
the finite; and a large class of philosophers and theologians
conceive man as formed in the divine image,
and suppose the expression that God made man in his
own image, to refer to an external as well as internal
likeness.</p>

<p>Man as an individual occupies the highest plane; he
has attained to the third degree of life as a Spiritual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
being, consequently he becomes immortal. If the third
degree of life brings man into communion with the
self-living and divine, he becomes immortal; if not,
then he is not immortal; for that only is immortal
which receives into itself that which is self-living, self-sufficient,
and self-existent, that which can not be dissolved
or disorganized. If man has not attained to
that plane which joins upon that which is self-existent,
he is not immortal. The simple fact that man can
think, will, and act, proves nothing for his immortality.
The dog can act, and think, and will, but that does not
make the animal immortal. Those who base immortality
upon that, do not perceive its real basis. Man
becomes immortal by his <i>relation</i> to that which is self-existent
and self-sufficient, and has that self-sufficient
condition brought into him by induction. He receives
it by a sort of divine induction. I have brought in a
chart to illustrate the principle of induction or the law
of progression. You observe that man stands at the
head of form and life, though not at the head of consciousness.
He is as a finite being produced only to
the second degree of consciousness. That is the last
step man took. Man has advanced to the second degree
of consciousness, which looks to the relational and
finite, hence man as a moral being, as a finite being;
and that which he investigates in virtue of his faculties
as a moral being must be finite. He can therefore only
investigate in the sphere of the finite. The moment
he attempts to embrace the infinite, and translate that
into the finite, that moment he is pushing his investigations
beyond his development.</p>

<p>But there is not only this second degree of conscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>ness,
which notices the relation, but there is a third degree,
which notices or perceives the absolute. It perceives
not only outward form and mediate relation, but
the absolute essence of all being. Man attains to that,
not because that third nature is individualized in him,
but because by reason of its conjunction upon that
condition which is known as the absolute, he has that
condition in him by a sort of induction—a non-individualized
condition, a sort of resident divinity in
him, gives him this third degree.</p>

<p>Now permit me to illustrate the principle of induction.
You understand, when electric conditions are
produced, that there is such a thing as causing them
by induction. You understand that negative attracts
positive, and that positive attracts negative—that where
these opposite conditions prevail there is a tendency
to bring them together. Similar conditions repel, and
opposite conditions attract, each other. We understand
that all electrical currents are double—that there
is a primary and a secondary current. In vitality, in
nerve-aura, in whatever acts as a medium, there is a
double current. The second current is within the primary,
and runs in the opposite direction. It is more interior
than the primary. Now, if I have a body charged
positively, and I bring it into a certain relation to
another body, it imparts its electricity to it. This is
called producing the condition by induction. I speak
now of progression under this law of induction.</p>

<p>Suppose, now, that we take the two great principles
of life—consciousness and action on the one hand, and
death, unconsciousness, or inertia on the other hand—one
being impartive and the other negative and re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>ceptive.
God on the one hand and matter on the other.
(Pardon me for speaking of God as a principle, the
subject requires it. Whatever is attempted to be explained
in language must necessarily be considered as
finite.) Now, whatever pertains to the divine and absolute
on the one hand, the very opposite pertains to
matter on the other hand; hence we speak of the sufficiency
of Deity and the inertia of matter. This
principle of inertia, however, is as essential to the development
of form and individuality in the finite as
the principle of consciousness is to the conscious being.
Without the two conditions, that which is mediate
could not be elaborated or produced. God’s creative
agency, the positive current, passes out upon matter,
from which there is a current returning to mind, in
which negative current individualization takes place.
The returning current first begins to elaborate form;
next, with the progress of matter, comes individuality;
next, personality. The formative principle is in the
secondary current, which produces induction; but that
which is interior to form and elaborates it is the induced
or positive current, which partakes of the positive
or energetic action of the divine current, so to
speak. In this way, by induction, form after form is
elaborated and made to become the receptive of certain
conditions. Matter has no power of itself, but at
the same time is receptive of influences or conditions.</p>

<p>Two theories have prevailed respecting the origin of
man. One is what we call the theory of supernaturalism,
which supposes that the divine being, at a certain
period of time, when every other condition was fulfilled,
came down, and by special power formed man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
in his present shape, and imparted to him his present
spiritual life; and that from that man thus formed, and
a woman formed for his companion, sprang all the rest
of the human family. Others, who adhere to this idea
in general, suppose that there was a plurality of parents,
from whom the human race have proceeded. The
opposite theory is, that man has been developed from
the animal kingdom—that he is a development of the
animal in a higher plane. This theory was advocated
by La Marc. Now, I believe in neither theory. The
truth lies between the two. In the outset I made this
remark, which I intended to be understood as meaning
all that it implied: that God is the Father of the spirit,
while matter is the mother of the form. Matter is
finite in all its attributes and qualities. God is infinite
in all his attributes and qualities. Man is taken
from the finite in his lower plane. His form is nourished
and fed by its connection with the finite, and
when the spirit is separated therefrom, this portion of
man goes to decay; and so far as he is concerned as
an individual, he is no more. On the other hand, man
comes from the infinite, in the higher department of
his being, so that man partakes of both the finite and
the infinite. He is in the image of his mother, as well
as of his father. He is created in the image of God
and the image of matter. He has both an individuality
and a personality. In his finity he is an individual;
in his divinity he is personal. Therefore man contains
in himself all the germinal elements of the universe,
and also the representative elements of the Divine
Being.</p>

<p>As a being of form man became receptive of con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>ditions.
The mineral eventually became receptive of
the principle of life, which developed the vegetable
kingdom. The moment this life-principle began to
work in producing organic structure and multiplying
relations and conditions, a variety of forms succeeded,
until forms were brought to such a point that they
became receptive of a higher principle—the nerve
principle or consciousness, and the animal kingdom
was the result. The vegetable kingdom only produced
the form. The spirit came into it by induction from
the other direction. The vegetable did not produce
the animal; it merely produced the conditions by
which this conscious principle could be induced into
the individuality developed by the vegetable. That
individuality was raised out of the vegetable and placed
upon the animal plane, and a new kingdom was born
by the application of the law of commensurability.
Eventually form was elaborated through the entire
animal kingdom until the highest form the nerve-principle
could produce, was produced.</p>

<p>The human form was elaborated through the animal
kingdom, but the spirit was not elaborated there.
When the nerve-principle had done its best, had fulfilled
its highest possible condition, and had brought
form to join upon spirit, the condition of spirit was
induced into this form; and the induction of that
spirit raised the form of the animal kingdom into the
human kingdom; and the first man thus stood forth,
produced by the divine breath breathing into him,
consequently the difference between the lowest man
and the highest animal was very slight. The man, to
be sure, takes his animal body, appetites, senses, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
the laws which govern in the development of his body,
from the animal, but not that which pertained to his
spiritual, nature. It received this from above by the
induction of the divine principle which took hold of
the form and raised him out of the animal kingdom;
so that man does not trace his parentage to the animal
but to God. He has been begotten by the spirit and
power of God, operating through every plane of being
and action from the crystal to the divine. I detract
nothing from the divine wisdom and power when I
say that God works in an orderly and methodic manner.
Forms are of the earth, but the spirit is from
heaven. The first man is of the earth, earthy; the
second man is the lord from heaven.</p>

<p>Every operation on the material side of the universe
looks to the ultimating of a form which shall be so
perfect as to become receptive of a spirit which shall
be capable of living forever, of being conscious of all
that is, of being truly affected by that which it perceives.
There is not an operation in nature, not even
the progress of the comet in its path, which does not
look to the production of a human being, the production
of an immortal soul. There is not a manifestation
of power or wisdom in the world which is not
laboring and conspiring to accomplish this great end
of producing a son, a child of God, which shall be
capacitated to be receptive of its divine origin. We
shall eventually see that every law which we now think
is working for destruction, is but the going forth of
the divine power to produce the being, man.</p>

<p>I said that man was not immortal in consequence of
his spirit-individuality alone. The reason that man is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
immortal is very manifest. The highest principle in
the animal individuality is the nerve-principle, the
principle of consciousness which can perceive material
forms and material phenomena. That interior principle
is not unfolded in the animal. The inmost principle
of the animal, I grant, is spiritual, but that principle
is not individualized. The animal has only the
nerve-principle, but in the spirit-principle; and joining
perceive facts and phenomena; but he can not perceive
relations—has no desire after relations—and
knows nothing of moral duties. He can not be active
in that way, because his highest individuality is his
mere nervous individuality. God does not breathe into
the animal that breath of life which makes him a living
soul. But man is individualized not only in this
nerve-principle, but in the spirit-principle; and joining
upon the infinite he does take the divine breath into
him as the inmost principle of his being. Man is immortal
by his relation to the self-sufficient and self-existent.
It is his <i>relation</i> to God that makes him immortal.
The animal is not immortal, because he has
not this relation. Man having this higher principle
individualized in him becomes a religious being.</p>

<p>In the example heretofore cited of Sir Isaac Newton
and his dog perceiving the falling of an apple, the
dog was seen as observing only the fact, while Sir
Isaac Newton observed the law, which he called gravitation;
yet not being developed in his divine consciousness,
which perceives the absolute and divine,
he could not tell the absolute cause of the phenomenon.
The dog is in the manifestational sphere, while
Sir Isaac Newton was developed in the manifestational<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
and relational, but not yet in the absolute, but was
capable of being developed in that sphere by induction.
Man is therefore a microcosm. He has all those
conditions which pertain to the universe. He is its
fruit. There are three stages in the development of
man: first, form; second, individuality; third, personality—to
which Jesus made allusion in speaking of the
development of fruit, saying that there was first the
blade, next the ear, and after that the full corn. Man,
standing at the head of the development, is the fruit of
the universe. He is the grand ultimate of all preceding
action. He is the footings-up of all that is and all
that has been. There is no condition of being not a
condition of relation in the wide universe which man
does not contain in some department of his being; and
just as he unfolds in his conscious nature, does he
represent different spheres in the Spiritual world. If
in self-lust, he registers his name in that department
of the Spiritual universe called Gehenna, if in charity,
he records his name in the sphere Paradise; and if in
divine love—if the divine is so developed in him that it
is a ruling love—he is registered in heaven; and then
it is he perceives God. If he is developed like the
Man of Nazareth, so that his Father’s will is his will,
so that he can bow submissively to it, whether it be to
inflict pain and death or life and prosperity, he is born
into the absolute or divine. This, then, is the simple
law of unfolding. Man becomes in the Spirit-world
what he is in himself. When you determine where
his ruling love is, you have determined his sphere;
and if he is to manifest to this world, he will manifest
according to the sphere he is in. He advances by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
same principle of induction as is concerned in the development
of his personality. It is as the poet remarks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“All angels form a chain which in God’s burning throne</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">begins,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And winds down to the lowest plane of earthly things.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Understand, then, each individual is a link in that
chain, all put together in the various degrees of unfolding.
So that “as each lifts his lower friends, can
each into superior joys ascend.” As you would raise
yourselves, raise the man next below you. As you
would labor to save yourself, labor to save your neighbor.
Your salvation consists in saving others. There
is no way in which a man so entirely defeats his own
happiness as when he attempts to make that happiness
his highest end. The pleasure-seekers will bear me
witness that the real happiness is in performing some
duty or fulfilling some end, not with a view to getting
happiness. If a man seeks after right, he can not
avoid happiness.</p>

<p>Now you can understand that it depends upon you
and me to determine our plane—to determine our condition
in the Spirit-world.</p>

<p>Jesus said to his disciples that when he should go to
his Father, they would see him no more, meaning that
he should no longer appear in his form—no longer
appear in the spheres of manifestation—Gehenna and
Paradise. He can only be communed with by those
in the same condition. But previous to going to his
Father he told them, “A little while and ye shall see
me.“ He was living then in his physical body, talking
with his disciples through their natural under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>standing.
He told them he was going to be gone a
little while, and would return; but after that he would
go to their Father, and they would see him no more.
He first went to Paradise, from whence he could manifest
himself. During forty days after his crucifixion
he remained in Paradise, which joins the natural
sphere, and manifested himself from time to time, endeavoring
to open communication between the Spiritual
and natural sphere. Having spent forty days
developing his apostles as mediums, he went to his
Father, into a sphere which is not one of manifestation,
and they saw him no more. I do not mean that
he went to a particular place, but that he went into a
more interior condition; that is, he retired from the
external to the absolute and divine, and of course could
no longer be made manifest; and according to the description,
he was separated from his disciples, and a
cloud received him out of sight—not a literal cloud,
but that interior condition of divine personality which
made him invisible to them as a spiritual being, where
he has continued from that time to the present. The
second sphere, Paradise, is that in which angels are
said to be God’s messengers. God can not directly
communicate his consciousness to us in this sphere.
He simply give his consciousness to his angels, who
translate it into the external sphere.</p>

<p>In speaking of the Divine Being as nearly as possible
in external language, I would say that He is a
personality, but not an individuality. Individuality is
finite necessarily; therefore all the ideas originating
from such an individuality are finite; hence if you attempt
to portray the Infinite in your imagination, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
make him finite, and just so sure as you attempt to
make that finite image or idea represent the Infinite,
that moment you involve yourself in inextricable confusion.
You make an individual of God and make
him finite. By personality, which is quite another
thing, I refer to this principle of consciousness. That
being only has attained personality where the subject
arises and the object terminates within himself. That
being is a personality alone who possesses self-existence
and self-sufficiency. Now I standing before you am
liable to influences outside of myself. An act arising
from such influences is not strictly mine, not depending
entirely upon me for its existence. If you influence
me, and my act be a good one, you are entitled to part
of the credit; if it be bad, you are chargeable with part
of the censure. You can see that under this law of
motive, which belongs to the first and second spheres
of mind, no action depending upon outward condition
is perfect, not being self-sufficient or self-existent. It
belongs to the individuality; but when the act is of
such a character that it can not receive outward influence
arising from a sort of divine spontaneity, it is
self-existent and self-sufficient, and the person capable
of such an act may be said to be a personality; that
is, he is becoming independent—attaining to a self-sufficiency
and self-existence. An individual is neither.
It is only that which receives. Hence man, who is said
to be begotten the child of God, has another’s self-sufficiency.
All that he has he has received. Said Jesus,
speaking from the natural plane, “I can of my own self
do nothing. As I hear I judge. It is not I that doeth
the work, but the Father that dwelleth in me that doeth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
the work.” So you will understand what I mean when
I say that man as a separate individual has a finite
being, but in his connection with the Divine Being he
becomes a personality, not of his own, but as a personality
in God. The universal and eternal personality
of God is in him. This is the relation we sustain
as finite beings to the Infinite.</p>

<p>I expect not to convey my idea in a very clear manner.
I can only point in the direction, and say investigate
in that direction and you will find the infinite.
I can only give a negative description of the infinite
by saying what it is not, and ask you to pursue the
positive in your inmost consciousness; and after a
little while you will see some glimmering of the instinct
infinite. Then all your doubts about the infinite
will cease. You will then be able to perceive, although
not able to describe, how it is that there is an infinite
Father whose love and wisdom is over all his works.</p>

<small>MEDIUMSHIP.</small></h2></div>


<p>My subject of discourse this evening is that of mediumship.
There are two classes of mediumship, and
only two: that which is external, that which reaches
the consciousness through the region of thought; and
the internal, that which reaches it directly in the affections.
The most imperfect as a means of communication
is what is known as the external, its imperfection
being due to the fact of its having to employ in its
communication certain signs or symbols, which signs
or symbols each individual must translate by his own
standard—by his own understanding. Its perfection
as a means of communication depends, first, upon the
perfection of the communicator; secondly, upon the
perfection of the understanding of the individual to
whom the communication is made. If the communication
pertain to those things belonging to the common
plane of the understanding, and the individual communicating
and the one to whom the communication
is made understand alike the symbols used, the method
of communication is comparatively perfect. I am
obliged to make use of certain natural words which
are signs of ideas. If you understand these words
precisely as I do, I will succeed in conveying my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
ideas. But if the slightest difference exist between us
in the use of words, a perfect communication can not
take place. You understand how this is. Nothing is
more common in an audience like this than for different
individuals to understand the speaker differently,
though each individual heard the same words. But
different conclusions are attained because each interprets
by his own standard.</p>

<p>We can not be perfect in our external methods of
communication any further than we each occupy the
same plane in our communication, and understand
alike the symbols used. If I were describing simple
natural things, and describing them by natural qualities,
there would be no difficulty, perhaps, in conveying
a definite idea. I may not fail in describing objects
by using such terms as “red, white, round,
square, angular,” because these terms are commonly
well understood. So in regard to all the natural qualities
of objects with which we are familiar. We have
the correct elements out of which to construct a correct
idea. Therefore, while I am communicating on
the natural plane where we all possess the same consciousness,
external language answers very well as a
means of communication.</p>

<p>But suppose I attempt to go into a more interior
truth—that which does not address each one’s consciousness
through the sense. I am obliged, however,
to make use of external language; but as the interior
truth is more interior than the natural plane, I must
employ that language figuratively—must speak by
parables, similes, and allegories. But the moment we
begin to use language in that manner we are very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
liable to be misunderstood. The individual inclined
to understand all things on the natural plane will very
likely fail to get the spiritual idea which is figuratively
conveyed. A truth expressed in figurative language,
the figure being a natural one, will be understood by
the one who takes it literally in one way, while he who
takes it in a spiritual sense will get a different idea.
So whenever we attempt to teach by parables, there is
a very great liability of diversity of understandings.
I refer to this to show that in communicating by external
language, we are very liable to be misunderstood,
unless we confine our subjects to the natural plane,
and describe natural things by such properties as are
common to all, and are accurate in putting them together,
when we may succeed tolerably well. But if
we omit any of these essential particulars, there will
be almost as great a diversity of opinions as there are
diversity of minds to hear the communications.</p>

<p>Many persons have thought that if they become mediums,
and could see disembodied Spirits in the Spiritual
world, and see how they are associated together
there, they would become wise. As a mere observation
of the vegetable kingdom serves simply to acquaint
one with its various forms, but not with its uses, so a
view of the Spiritual world might acquaint one with the
fact that Spirits existed, of their employments, etc.;
but the real interior truth, which is necessary to enter
into you and make you wise, can not be acquired in
this way.</p>

<p>The idea that we can get perfect communication externally,
when we are imperfect ourselves, is altogether
a fallacious idea. We depend upon our understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>ings
for the meanings of communications addressed to
us; and just so far as you are developed to understand
perfectly, you may get a perfect impression. But just
so far as it is above your comprehension, you are liable
to misunderstand, and charge the fault upon your communicator.
The proposition is simply this: You and
I can not understand infallibly what is truth, unless we
are infallible ourselves in the determination of truth.
That which, of itself, is fallible and liable to err, can
not determine the quality of infallibility; and whenever
an individual affirms, upon some authority, the
truth of any thing which, by his acknowledgment, lies
beyond the plane of his intellectual development, he
asserts something unphilosophical and false. That is
only truth which, in our minds, corresponds to the actuality.
It matters not who speaks, even though it be
God; just so long as you must depend upon your understanding
to interpret the meaning of what is said,
you are liable to get a falsehood instead of truth. The
question of truth depends as much upon you as the
communicator. There has been a great deal of discussion
about the infallibility of the Koran, of the Shasters,
of the Vedas, of the Bible, and of the Book of
Mormon. It has all proceeded upon an erroneous idea.
Although the book may contain infallible truth, yet
since you have to depend upon your understanding to
interpret the language employed, you may fail to get
the truth. You need to be infallible before you can
affirm that you have the truth. You hand me the
Bible, perhaps, saying that it is the Word of God, that
it was given by inspiration of God, and that every word
it contains is true, infallibly true. Very well. Do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
you wish me to receive the entire book of paper, ink,
and calf-skin, to take the book and read it, and believe
what it says? I must receive it as I understand it,
and faith, therefore, corresponds to my understanding
of the book. Is my faith in the book, or my understanding
of the book? When a man affirms the infallibility
of the Bible, he affirms the infallibility of his understanding.
It appears that your faith can not be in the
Bible, whatever it may teach. Your faith is only in
your understanding of the Bible; and if your understanding
happens to correspond exactly with the truth,
you then have the truth. But if your understanding
happens to be erroneous, your faith is in a falsehood.
You affirm, then, that God teaches that which He does
not teach; and you make your falsehood God’s truth.</p>

<p>I want to make this plain, for here the law of outward
communication is abundantly manifest. Look
the world over and see how many different sects there
are in Christendom: Baptists, Universalists, Presbyterians—I
could not begin to name them all over to-night.
They all take the same book and learn from
the same source; and yet they come to very different
conclusions. You may take any one doctrine which
you may think the Bible teaches—and I will immediately
find you a denomination who will deny it.
One says that it teaches universal salvation, and another
affirms that it teaches almost as universal damnation.
Each man translates it by his own understanding;
and each affirms that he has infallible truth.
If they would just take this simple proposition, that
that which is fallible can not determine the quality of
infallibility—that upon these subjects the human mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
is fallible, and therefore can not determine what is the
absolute meaning of the communications—they would
learn the source of all their errors. Men may be ever
so honest, they will differ as a consequence of their
constitutional differences. A man whose intellectual
faculties are strongly developed, who will reason and
demonstrate every thing rationally, will be a Presbyterian.
Hence the expression “long-faced Presbyterian.”
It is very common for them to be long-faced.
They are very actual, never have much feeling, and
sit perfectly quiet. The minister must do all the talking,
and the singers must do all the singing. The
round, full-faced, emotional kind of man will not be a
Presbyterian. You could not force him to be, because
he judges by a different standard. He would be a
Methodist. He would judge by the standard of feeling,
and must have a great deal of noise; and a meeting
is not worth a fig to him unless he can have a
dozen round him shouting “Glory!” The Presbyterian,
all reason, says God is omnipotent and omniscient;
therefore He foreknew what should come to
pass, and that, therefore, God foreordains whatever
comes to pass. This is one of his cardinal doctrines.
The Methodists says: “If that be true, man is not a
free agent; but I feel that he is.” He decides from
feeling; the Presbyterian from thought. They can
not read the same book and come to the same conclusion.
There is a constitutional difference between the
two. If they are to determine upon truth by outward
communication they can not arrive at it. The man who
feels pretty savage is ready to accept the doctrine of
damnation. He feels that certain persons ought to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
punished, and he thinks God will punish them. Here
is another man who is all sympathy and love. He
can not see how one man should, under any circumstances,
want to injure another man, and he comes to
the conclusion that all men are going to be saved.
He thinks that if God is as good as he is, and he is
sure He is, He will contrive some way to save all.
That man will preach the doctrine of universal
salvation.</p>

<p>So true is it, that phrenological differences point out
different religious beliefs, that in almost any congregation
you can sort out the Presbyterians from the
Methodists, etc. This is a truth that God, nature, experience—every
thing teaches. What is the use of
quarreling about it, as long as we know that individuals
hearing a discourse come to different conclusions.
They do, they must, they will, and they can not help
it. Until they come to a more interior plane they can
never have one faith, one Lord, one baptism.</p>

<p>Now you understand what I mean by what is called
the external communication. Suppose the Spirits make
a communication, they make it in words. These words
only address your consciousness through your understanding,
and you make them mean according to your
understanding of them. If the Spirit makes a communication
by pantomime, it still appeals to your understanding,
and depends upon your translation to
give it significance. There may be error in the communication
and in yourself, so that the error will be
double. It is in this way that very many errors which
have been charged upon the Spiritual world, after all,
have their origin in the mistranslation and the mis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>understanding
of those who hear the communication.
The teachings of Jesus, I think, are straightforward
enough, if you will come to the plane of understanding
to which they were addressed. Being spiritual,
they can not be truly represented by natural ideas and
language. For that reason he was obliged to teach by
the use of parables, figures, and similes; and when he
had done the best he could, the disciples, being educated
in the natural plane, interpreted his language
naturally, and, consequently, misapplied what he said.
This is the fault to the present day. The truths he
sought to communicate were peculiarly spiritual, and
natural language could only represent them when used
figuratively; hence he made choice of such similes or
parables as would convey his meaning approximately,
yet not without liability of material error. Hence he
declared to his disciples, with whom he had been so
long familiar, that they did not understand him, and
could not, until the Spirit of truth should come to lead
them into the truth of what he had taught. Language
could not convey the truth, else it would undoubtedly
have been so given. He knew how to describe the
things of the Spiritual world so far as they could be
described, for the Spirit had been poured out upon
him without measure; but natural language could not
portray the truths, scenery, and events of the Spirit-world.</p>

<p>The only perfect mode of communication is the interior
method, or communication by inspiration. As
a means of becoming wise, it becomes necessary for us
to seek by some means to come into interior communion
with the Spirit-world and Divine Being, since we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
can not by outward means arrive absolutely at the
truth. If we will know that truth which is required
to build us up into eternal life, we must ascertain what
conditions are necessary to be observed to bring us
into interior communion with the Spirit, so that without
outward sign they can flow directly into our consciousness,
and be written upon the thought or heart,
as was said, “I will put my law into their understandings,
and I will write it upon their affections.” Thus
truth must come to us without any recourse to Bibles
or any other standard whatever. It so happens that
the means by which we are to attain to interior communion
are open to all. It is possible for every person
to come into <i>rapport</i> with the interior spheres.
According to one’s ruling love or desire will be his
affinity or communion with the spheres of the Spirit-world.
If that be high, his communion will be high.
If low, his communion will be low.</p>

<p>I will illustrate what I mean by interior communication.
Suppose that some of you have a pain in the
head. After your best attempts to describe it to me
by natural language, I might not get of it a correct
idea. But by putting myself in a negative condition
to you, I could receive the pain myself, and be able to
understand its character precisely. You thus communicate
through the nervous medium interiorly.
Many persons in public assemblies are liable to receive
headaches of others by coming into <i>rapport</i> with
them.</p>

<p>In each there is that which corresponds to all
the media in the outward universe. There is a material
earth, and I possess a material body. There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
electricity, and I have electricity in my system. There
is magnetism, and I have magnetism. There is a life-principle
expanding all over the world, and I am in
communication with that vital medium, and through it
exert a vital influence upon others, and they upon me.
This process of healing by mesmerizing is only coming
into <i>rapport</i>, so that the vital forces of the healthy person
enter in and strengthen the vital forces of the weak.
Then there is a nerve-media existing around and in the
individual, through which the pains of others are communicated
to him. Pain in another causes an action
in this nerve-medium which communicates the pain to
me; just as my voice causes a vibration of the physical
atmosphere, which action is communicated to your
organs of hearing. The sounds I produce have certain
meanings attached to them. If you understand them
precisely as I do, you get a perfect communication.
But any description in natural language of a pain would
be inadequate. But when I receive it myself, I have
in every respect an adequate idea of it. Very often,
standing near individuals, I have told them what
difficulties they were laboring under by experiencing
them in myself. It is in this manner that clairvoyants
frequently tell what ails their patient.</p>

<p>If I go on and describe your pains, there is nothing
astonishing in it. I am simply in <i>rapport</i> with your
nerve-medium. I am sometimes wondered at for this,
but I might be a fool and yet do it. There is no wisdom
involved in such a power; and it is erroneous to
suppose, as some do, that because clairvoyants can tell
them what ails them, they can tell them how to cure
it. These powers belong to very different classes, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
they may be united in the same individual, and he may
be competent to discover disease and to prescribe its
remedy. I refer to this simply to correct the false impression
that clairvoyance is a wondrous power. It is
one of the simplest powers in nature. It is one of the
powers that may be made use of to bless; but if not
properly understood, it may be made use of to curse.
What is true in regard to this nervous medium is true
also of thought. You often witness cases of this kind
in mesmeric and magnetic experiments, when the subject
and operator being brought into <i>rapport</i>, whatever
one thinks the other thinks—what one wills the
other wills. The idea is transmitted perfectly.</p>

<p>There is what is called thought-reading. This is
governed by the same law precisely as that of which I
have been speaking. One mind communicates its motion
to the other by means of a medium, just as I communicate
to your organs of hearing the vibrations of
my organs of speech, through the medium of the atmosphere.
When I have a thought which is an active
condition of the mind, which may be denominated
mental action, it is transmitted to the Spirit-medium
or Spiritual atmosphere, and undulates through that
until it strikes upon that receptive mind where the
same motion is communicated, and the same thought
produced, and the thought is impressed upon the consciousness.
The one receiving it perceives it precisely
as its communicator. Such a communication does not
depend upon the Understanding simply for its perfection.
This is what we call interior communication.
According to the elevation of our Spiritual sphere in
the sphere of truth or love, as we approach the infinite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
and absolute, will be the perfection of this method of
communication. If we are very low, it corresponds
very much to the external mode. But as we raise, it
becomes more interior and refined, until finally, being
unfolded to the plane of the absolute in our consciousness,
perceptions, and affections, we shall come into
direct <i>rapport</i> with the infinite, and receive communications
directly from the Divine—not by any outward
sign or symbol, but by the inflowing of the Divine
thought and affection. This is the way and the only
way that Spiritual truths can be communicated. The
reason that Jesus of Nazareth did not communicate
sufficient truth to the world to enlighten it, was simply
because the world was not prepared to receive it. He
said that he had many things to communicate, but they
could not bear them. He also said that the man coming
after him, living the life he had lived, should do
greater things, because there would be a higher and
wider plane. The world was too low, too animal, to
receive his doctrine. For that reason he was obliged
to go away, saying to his disciples that they did not
understand him, and it was necessary that the Spirit
of truth should come and illumine their understandings
before they could understand him.</p>

<p>If I wish to understand Spiritual truth, no man or
medium can be a medium for me, and I can not be a
medium for you. Jesus of Nazareth can not be a
medium for one of you, nor can God himself. Every
individual who would understand the truths of the
Spiritual world must be his or her own medium. God
must write his law upon your understanding, and put
it in your affections. If you want to become mediums<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
for interior communications, you must become absolutely
true in every thought, feeling, and affection—become
absolutely pure in every desire and aspiration
of your souls—become absolutely just in all your relations
of life, so that morning, noon, and night you
shall be inquiring and thirsting after righteousness.
Such an individual will not need any outward signs to
convey truth to him. But the person disposed to live
in the outward world, to live in the enjoyment of his
appetites and lustful affections, will require representations,
if he ever believes in Spirits. He has to be
addressed as a physical or sensuous being. If he ever
believes in a future life, the Spirits have got to come
and rap him over his head. These outward manifestations
are designed to say to the sordid atheist, to the
materialist, to the religious worldling, “You have a
soul.” It is for this reason that there is speaking with
tongues, and that all the wonderful works are wrought
in your midst. That is what makes Mr. Davenport’s
circles necessary for the vast majority of the citizens
of New York. They are not sufficiently developed to
understand Spiritual truth. These manifestations are
necessary. They are not calculated to make you wise,
but they can startle you, and prompt you to investigate;
and they can give you such direction as will
prepare you to enter into a higher and holier investigation
of your relation to the world and to the Divine
Father. It makes little difference whether they lie or
tell the truth, provided they satisfy you that you have
souls. If they were always to tell you the truth, you
would be too dependent upon them. You have intellectual
faculties—exercise them, and you will never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
find yourself in a position where you can not find all
the light you need. A great many people who believe
that Spirits do communicate, can hardly go to dinner
without the consent of the Spirits. They make babes
of themselves, and afterward become fools. If the
Spirits tell me to do a thing which my judgment says
I should not do, I tell them, “I won’t. I will do the
best I know how; and I would rather trust myself
than you.” I always get along a great deal better in
this way than I would by getting Spirits to rap according
to my expectations. They are not designed to become
our governors. Sensible Spirits do not ask any
such thing. There are ninnies in the Spiritual world
as in this, who will be glad to become governors,
if they can get dupes enough. The object of this
external communication is to give outward evidence.
The Corinthians had terrible times. Some people
coming in said they were drunkards. Some said they
were mad. Some spoke in tongues. Paul reproved
them for this kind of talk. He told them that it was
well to speak with tongues, but he would endeavor
to make some use of it, and would rather speak
five words with the understanding than ten thousand
in tongues. The tongues are for a sign to those who
are not believers. The man or woman that is not
established in the faith that Spirits can communicate,
needs these outward manifestations; but when established,
it is all time thrown away to be chasing after
these communications. Persons had better be in their
closets, throwing their aspirations for a higher and
holier life, and pray until, by their earnest aspirations,
they call angels of the brightest spheres to come and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
be with them. They would find themselves getting
along much better, and would give to Spiritualism a
very different character from what it now bears in the
wide world. I talk plain. I am in earnest. We have
had nonsense and folly enough. It is time we become
rational, learn the use of our faculties, and use them
aright.</p>

<p>Everything has its true mission. Let, then, every
thing be done decently and in order. If Spiritualism
is that which is to redeem the world, we shall find it
out by finding whether it makes us better; and if it
will not make the world better, we want nothing more
of it. We need no more raps than will save humanity.
We need all we can get for that purpose. If
Spiritualism takes that direction, it is a God-send to
the world; and in whatever sphere the Spirit can
work, let it work. I bid it God-speed. But I say to
all, that if Spiritualism, in its faith and effects, does
not tend to make you wiser, better, purer, and holier
men and women, it is good for nothing. That Spiritualism
which will not redeem you and me will not be
sufficient to redeem the world. Therefore let our faith
be shown by our works—be exhibited by the influence
it shall exert upon our lives and characters in making
us purer, better men and women—just men and
women.</p>

<small>MEDIUMSHIP—SPIRITUAL HEALING.</small></h2></div>


<p>When we make use of external language as a means
of communication, our reception of truth does not depend
so much upon who speaks, as upon ourselves;
for it matters not who uses language, before it can
awaken the idea in our minds, it must first be communicated
to our understanding. Therefore though
the communication may convey established truth, our
understanding is quite liable to err as to the meaning
of the communication. Though the communication
were made by God himself, it might not convey the
truth, because each man or woman would understand
it according to his or her plane of development. The
character of a communication is determined by the
plane from which it is translated. The caution is,
“Take heed how ye hear.”</p>

<p>However credible and truthful an individual may be,
he may be mistaken, and falsify in respect to facts and
principles communicated; so that unless we have an
absolute perception of the truth of that which is communicated,
we can not affirm that we have the truth
upon the subject in question. In holding communication
with our neighbor, we find that A or B or C has
always told the truth, and therefore when he tells us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
a particular event has taken place, we rely upon his
word. Yet we know that he is liable to be mistaken,
and to be under influences which may lead him to
falsify, so that after all we can not know, upon the
report of an individual, that a thing is true. It does
not address that department of our being by which we
are made as certain of it as we are that we exist.
Hence we always make a difference between what we
know and what we hear—between a report and our
consciousness. One we say we <i>know</i> to be true, and
the other we say we <i>believe</i> to be true. The difference
is that between knowledge and belief. So if a Spirit
should communicate to me ten thousand facts concerning
my absent friends, every one of which I should
find in every respect true on investigation; and if,
again, that Spirit should come and communicate still
other facts, I can not know that such other facts are
true. The fact that that Spirit has before told the
truth is not a positive proof that it will continue to do
so. I can believe the statement to be true, but, nevertheless,
my belief can not amount to positive knowledge.
So that the questions often arise when Spirits
communicate with external language, How are we to
know that they tell the truth, How are we to know that
they are the ones they purport to be? When a Spirit
raps out on the table, or speaks or writes through
a medium, that he is such a Spirit, and that such and
such things are transpiring at some distant place, how
are we to know that he tells the truth? We are not
to know it, and can not know it. If we are to be
accurately informed on that subject, that which is
addressed to our understanding must come more in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>teriorly
into our consciousness than it can come
through the ear, the eye, or the sense of feeling. It
may be true; and give me time enough to investigate,
and I can determine whether it be true or not. But
if I am to act upon it without investigation, I can not
know. I do not care if all the Spirits in Christendom
testify to it, still I can not know; for that means of
communication can not, in the nature of things, bring
certainty—can not produce interior conviction in the
mind.</p>

<p>I may be persuaded that a thing is so, and shape my
course as though it were so; still I am liable to be
mistaken. Therefore I affirm again, that this outward
method of communication can not be relied upon for
the communication of absolute or positive truth. You
can not make it the basis of action as you can when
you have clear and positive information; and even if it
should become as reliable as the ordinary communications
passing between man and man, still it will not
bring sufficient certainty to make it the basis of action.
I might give many other reasons why this external
means of communication can not be relied upon as sufficient
to give us the necessary information respecting
our connection with the Spirit-world. It may give
facts or tests which may prove to be sufficient to satisfy
the mind of every inquirer that Spirits do exist and
communicate. This is no unusual thing; but the point
is to make them the instruments of communicating to
us such information as from day to day we need, and
upon which we must rely. Those who do thus rely
upon their communications, and yield implicit confidence
to them, nine times in ten show themselves to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
be complete dupes, and make themselves the laughing-stock
of every sensible man and woman.</p>

<p>You will find in all parts of the country those who,
if they can get a rap, say “Spirits, is it so?” and act
according to the responses they receive. Nothing can
be further from the true use and design of these manifestations.
My position is simply this: so far as these
outward means of communication are concerned, they
are designed for those who can not get a more interior
view of their relations with the Spirit-world. If an
individual is living in his exterior or sensuous nature,
so that what comes to his understanding must come
through his senses, then these outward manifestations
are useful and necessary to satisfy him of the fact that
Spiritual beings do exist, and have the means of communicating
with us. But when he is fully satisfied on
that point, he has received about all the benefit he can
from these exterior communications.</p>

<p>There is another important point to which I wish to
call your attention, and one which, if properly understood
by those who investigate the Spiritual phenomena,
will save them a great deal of embarrassment.
It is this: that that class of Spirits who usually manifest
themselves through public mediums, either by
sounds, by moving physical objects, or by any other
means before promiscuous objects, or by any other
means before promiscuous public assemblies, can not
generally be relied upon; and the reason is very obvious.
It is well understood that an individual who is
excessively sensitive to all moral influences—whose
sensibilities are such that they can not endure the
presence of that which is vulgar—are repelled by, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
driven from, promiscuous circles or society; and, consequently,
those who can endure the common influences
of a public circle can not be of a very sensitive
class. Take a medium who is exceedingly sensitive to
external influences; who must be in just such a condition
in order that the Spirits may communicate, and
who requires that every mind in the circle shall be in
a peculiar condition; and place that medium in a public
circle, and you can get no manifestations at all, for
the required conditions are foreclosed at once. This
kind of mediums will not answer for the purposes of
public circles; but if you get one that will answer for
such purposes, that medium will be one who is excessively
positive—one who can resist influences of ever
so positive a character. As that medium is required
to sit for all classes, as a matter of course he must be
in a condition to respond to the kind of influences
which are brought to bear upon him, or manifestations
can not occur while such influences are present.</p>

<p>When communications are received through public
mediums, the probabilities are that the communicator
belongs to a very low plane of development, and that
the communications can not be relied upon, whatever
may be the professions of that communicator.</p>

<p>There is almost always an influence which belongs
peculiarly to each public medium—an influence which
seems to be a presiding Spirit, which that medium will
usually recognize, answering to the name of “Jim” or
“John.” It is generally the case that this Spirit will
be found on hand first, and is the one to do whatever
is to be done; and he becomes the father, mother,
brother, sister, or friend of everybody. I speak from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
experience on this subject. If this Spirit wants to be
very accurate in telling you a name, he gets you to
write down a list of names, and as your finger runs
down the list, he raps when you come to the right one.
If he knows the name, why does he not spell it out?
This is a very reasonable question. Permit me to explain
how these questions are often answered. In mesmerism
there is at times a certain relation of the operator
to the subject called <i>rapport</i>, in which condition
the operator can transmit his mental motions to the
subject. In case a Spirit comes into <i>rapport</i> with yourself,
he answers all the questions you ask, even mental
questions, and you come to the conclusion that you
are really conversing with the one who purports to
answer. If you ask whether you have a father, mother,
brother, or sister in the Spirit-land, he will answer according
to your perceptions; and the tests seem to be
very good, though the Spirit is constantly answering
directly from your own mind. This often occurs in
public circles. Another individual, sitting next to you,
who is very anxious to get equally good tests from his
Spirit-friends, gets no correct answers unless he hands
his written questions to one who has been found to be
in <i>rapport</i> with the Spirit. I once knew an instance
of this kind. A doctor came into a circle with about
thirty mental questions, to which he desired to get responses;
but he could get no answers, it seeming impossible
for the Spirits to get the questions from his
mind; but upon his writing them out, and handing
them to a lady, who shortly before had succeeded in
getting answers, they were all replied to without difficulty.
The simple explanation of this fact is, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
lady was in <i>rapport</i> with the Spirit, and consequently
her thoughts could be seen by the Spirit, while he
could not perceive the thoughts of the physician, who
was not in <i>rapport</i> with him. If you ask questions
orally, it may be that the Spirit does not hear them,
except through the medium’s ears, so to speak. I
might go on thus to great extent, showing the liability
there is to be deceived in these public communications.</p>

<p>The circumstances of a public circle are exceedingly
unfavorable to getting communications from Spirits of
a high degree of refinement. The most that can be
obtained under such conditions is some external evidence
of Spiritual existence. The point to which I
wish to call your attention is the almost universal fact
that mediums devoted to external manifestations, while
under the influence of this presiding Spirit, are under
an influences to deceive, to cheat, which is almost irresistible.
It does not matter particularly how good
manifestations they get. I have seen this deceptive
disposition manifested in mediums who could get very
remarkable manifestations, such as the movement in
the open light of a table with several men standing
upon it. Not that they themselves wished to deceive,
but they were almost irresistibly controlled by the
influence surrounding them, and which must generally
be present in a large circle. I have seen this many
times when I knew the manifestations to be genuine.
A skeptic, however, notwithstanding their genuineness,
would, upon detecting the slightest thing like cheating,
pronounce them all a humbug. There are but few
mediums who could resist this influence which comes
over them at times, inciting them to help the mani<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>festations
along a little, or to give them a little start,
with the hope that they will thereafter get along without
assistance. I refer to this to call attention to the
influence to which mediums are at times subjected, not
to condemn the mediums, nor to convey the impression
that all these public manifestations are cheats. I
have seen many which were not of this character. This
cheating influence is attributable to the incongruous
mental condition of a large circle, where no care is
taken to secure harmony.</p>

<p>I offer these remarks as a caution not to get discouraged.
You will meet with these things; and if the
enemy can once catch you cheating, no matter how
many good demonstrations you have given for months
before, he has no hesitation in publishing to the world
that it is all a cheat. He requires the medium to be
very truthful, but he has no hesitation in lying himself.
Being judged out of his own mouth, the enemy
who takes advantage of the least deception on the part
of the medium is as bad as the medium, and if he gets
communications he must expect them to be marked by
his character.</p>

<p>Permit me now to call your attention to the subject
of healing mediumship. Man, as we have seen, possesses
within himself the elements of all prior existence—in
fact, of all existence, from dead matter to the
self-living Jehovah. These elements exist in him in an
individualized condition. He has composing his form
individualized matter of various kinds, as electricity,
magnetism, nerve-aura, which are connected with
matter of a like character which is unindividualized.
I need but say that all matter this side the Divine is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
of itself dead—that all life and consciousness flows
directly and indirectly from the Divine Being, and that
there can be no manifestation except as connected with
the Divine Being. The idea that magnetism, electricity,
or nerve-force has power of itself, is altogether
false. They are only connecting parts in the universe,
uniting the Divine on one hand with matter on the
other. They are mere media of communication between
the Fountain of all power on the one hand, and
the recipient of power on the other. Let us for illustration
observe a manufacturing establishment. One
part of the machinery is perhaps concerned in scouring
and cleansing wool; another part cards it into rolls;
another part spins them into yarn; another part weaves
the yarn into cloth; and another part dresses the cloth.
Each of these parts seems to be disconnected from the
other parts, and each seems to be accomplishing a
specific end; but you will find that all parts are connected
one with the other, and all connected with the
primary power in the basement. In the water-wheel
or steam-engine there is a power which puts them all
in motion. The parts next to it are negative to it, and
receptive of its power; and these parts, though negative
to the principal power, are positive to those parts
more remote. All parts are in motion, all moving as
the primary wheel moves. Break the connection anywhere
between the parts, and those parts beyond the
connection cease to move. But establish the connection,
and they will again commence their motion.
Every part is negative to the primary power, but positive
to all more remote from it than itself. No one of
the parts has a power to move itself, and unless there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
is a connection maintained between the primary power
and the several parts, they will cease to move. So
with all media through which potential manifestations
are made. Electricity has no power of itself. It is
only by its connection with that which is nearer to the
great self-existent Being that it derives all its power to
act. Next comes magnetism, which derives all the
power it possesses from the power which precedes it.
Next is the life-force, which is negative to all nearer to
God than itself, and receives its power from them, but
is positive to all others. Next comes the nerve-force;
and next the spirit, which derives all its power from
the Divine Fountain. It is the medium through which
all power is imparted to all that is more exterior than itself.
I have the power to move my arm—by my will
to make potential manifestations through this arm. If,
however, by any means, you break any of the links
out of the chain which unites the divine in me, through
my spirit, with the matter of my arm—abstract the
electricity, the magnetism, or nerve-force—I lose all
power over my arm. Bisect the motor-nerve, which
connects my arm with my brain, and my arm will hang
lifeless by my side. There are all of the media there,
but they are not continuously connected with my brain,
and through that with the Divine Fountain. But if you
will throw a current of electricity down the nerves of
my arm, you will produce an extension of it. So you
may withdraw the nerve-force, or the vital force from
my arm, and it will cease to exist. My arm will be
no longer subject to sensation, because you have broken
the link between sensation and matter.</p>

<p>We then, as individuals, possessing in ourselves all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
these different media, which become receptive of influences,
must come into connection with the Divine
Fountain itself, if we would receive power from it;
for we can impart nothing which we do not receive.</p>

<p>As spiritual beings we become receptive of this influence
through our spiritual nature, but impart it
through our lower nature. To become a medium of
potential action or manifestation, I must have the
power to impart to that medium through which the
power is to be manifested. To affect you nervously to
relieve you from pain, I must be able to impart through
my nervous system that power which I received
through my spiritual nature. To be able to operate
psychologically, I must receive through my interior
being and impart through my outward being—must
first have the powers of receptivity, and, secondly, must
possess the powers of impartability. It becomes just
as necessary to have a good, healthful physical development
to be able to impart, as to have a good spiritual
development to receive the power. The individual becomes
stronger as a medium in proportion to his development
in receptivity and impartability.</p>

<p>That Jesus was so much more powerful than others
was owing to the perfectly harmonic development of
his different natures. Our power to exert healing influences
depends upon our development. The higher
we are developed—the nearer we come to the great
absolute Fountain of all power—the more largely will
we be receptive of that power.</p>

<p>Jesus being fully developed in his religious and
spiritual being, was in conscious communion with the
Father and with Spirits of the most exalted character,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
and received largely of the Divine power. He was
always aware whether he had the necessary power to
perform any work. Being so fully unfolded as to perceive
the causes of the disease to be cured, he knew
beforehand whether it was worth while to make the
experiment. He knew what was to be done to bring
the individual into a condition to receive that which
he needed to restore him. Therefore, when called upon
to perform a cure, if the individual was not in the right
condition, he commenced to bring him into it, requiring
them to come into a certain condition called faith or
belief. That he might perform the desired work, he
required the assistance of those around him. When
he went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up,
and where he was looked upon as an ordinary man,
his right to teach was called in question, and his learning
doubted. What was his success there? Mark
says he did not succeed, because of their unbelief. He
could not command the conditions which were necessary
to impart his power, and he could do no mighty
work there, except to lay his hands on a few sick folks.
Another writer referring to it, says, “He did not many
mighty works there, because of unbelief.” We all
know that Jesus said, “A prophet is not without honor
save in his own country.“ He had to keep away from
Nazareth simply because the state of mind was such
that he could not control the conditions necessary to
produce his mighty works.</p>

<p>Within three weeks before his crucifixion, when
going to Jerusalem to attend one of the feasts, his
brethren called upon him and said, “If you do these
things, show yourself openly, for no man doeth these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
things in secret, and yet seeketh to be known openly;
for,” says John, “his brethren did not believe on
him.” Christ, even with his high degree of receptivity,
found it necessary at times to call to his aid
surrounding minds; and he could not always perform
his work without faith being reposed in him. The
question was very often asked by him, “Believe ye
that I am able to do this?” When he had performed
the cure, he immediately said “It is faith that did it.”
They had no faith in him as the Son of God, as supposed
by some, but simply in his power to work a
cure.</p>

<p>I desire to enforce the idea, that if we wish to be
mediums of high and exalted powers for the removal
of diseases, it becomes necessary that we should be
highly developed, not only physically, but spiritually
and religiously. A high order of the absolute religious
development is very essential to great power as a healing
medium, because this highest nature, this absolute
nature, in man, much more than any other, serves to
unite him with the absolute Fountain of all power.
The highest development of this religious nature in
man is necessary to give him a clear perception of the
nature of disease and the means for its removal. The
man who has this religious faculty highly developed,
needs not that any man should say anything to him
of man, for he knows what is within him. Clairvoyant
mediums know very well that that condition which
enables them to see most clearly the state of the individual
is that which is high and exalted; for when
their thoughts and aspirations seem to be ascending—like
the odor from the flower—there is a sort of con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>scious
exhalation going forth permeating every thing
around the individual, and he sees and feels clearly
the condition of everything by which he is surrounded.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the world which summons the
human being to such a degree of activity as that which
we call the religious nature—there is nothing which
takes hold of him so deeply. What other influence in
the world could cause a mother to destroy her babe,
but the stimulating influence of this religious nature,
coming up as it does from the deepest fountain of the
soul? Make a man believe that his religious nature
requires sacrifice, and he will make that sacrifice, cost
what it may, simply because his religious nature wells
up so strong when it is moved, that there is nothing
outward which can resist it. When the individual’s
religious nature is highly developed, it is more powerful
than all his other natures.</p>

<p>We will become healing mediums just in proportion
as we are developed in this religious nature, so that
we shall become more receptive and perceptive, and
be enabled to exercise stronger mental power to accomplish
our results. But a healthy physical development
is quite as essential to good mediumship as is a high
and healthy spiritual development. Good organs of
impartability are required. Secure a good harmonic
physical with a good harmonic spiritual development,
knowing that you are receptive on the Spiritual side,
and impartive on the physical side.</p>

<p>There is much folly connected with mediumship.
That such should be the case with people so profoundly
ignorant as the majority of mankind are with reference
even to their having souls, is by no means surprising.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
Many people suppose that if their hands are touched,
a Spirit has got hold of them, and is about to make
something great of them, and they set themselves up
as something wonderful. If they can perceive any influence
coming upon them, it is attributed to a Spiritual
agency. It may be so and it may not, because
there are other than Spiritual agencies. I once witnessed
the curing in five minutes of an individual who
had been blind for three years. This, told to the world
as an instance of Spiritual healing, would appear marvelous;
and if I had happened to do it on the platform,
before the people of New York, they would have
thought I had almost performed a miracle. It is probable
that not a particle of Spiritual influence was
exerted in the case. The individual performing the
cure did not suppose that he was a medium, though
some would not hesitate to publish it to the world as a
remarkable instance of healing by Spiritual aid. The
blindness was doubtless caused by a paralysis of the
optic nerve, and required only a little action to restore
the sight. The individual proceeded according to the
usual modes of mesmerism. The cure was not half as
difficult as it would be to get a sliver from under the
nail, nor was it half as mysterious.</p>

<p>A case of the restoration of hearing, by placing the
fingers in the ears and taking them out suddenly, is
also within my knowledge. Such cases are frequently
circulated as evidence that Spirits do cure. The cure
in this case was doubtless effected by a strong mesmeric
current passing from the fingers of the operator
over the nerve of the ear. As honest men and women,
we should be careful about publishing these things as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
instances of Spirit-healing. We have abundant <i>genuine</i>
evidence of what Spirits do. Attributing to Spirits
that which is not produced by them, tends to make us
dishonest with ourselves and our neighbors. Were
due caution exercised in this matter, we should not
need <i>half</i> the evidence which is now required to convince
the world that Spirits do exist and communicate.
When it is observed that everything is attributed to
Spirits, the world will not believe us even when we
tell them facts.</p>

<p>I know that Spirits <i>do</i> communicate—<i>do exist</i>. It is
not with me a matter of conjecture at all—I KNOW it;
but there is no occasion to make persons believe that
every thing comes from Spirits. I ask Spiritualists
to be more careful, more dignified in their investigations
in these matters, and they will find that there are
facts enough before the world to convince it of the
truths of Spiritualism, when you can convince the world
that you are duly cautious and not easily misled. I do
not wish to lie for Spirits, nor do I wish them to lie
for me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>CONDITION OF THE SPIRIT IN THE SPIRIT-WORLD.</small></h2></div>


<p>In order that I may present the general condition of
the Spirit in the Spirit-world in the most intelligible
form, it will be necessary for us to enter into a very
close and accurate analysis of what constitutes the
Spirit, because if we do not well understand what constitutes
the Spirit, we shall only be able to conjecture
of its condition of happiness in the Spirit-world; and
if we are to have a close and rigid analysis of the
Spirit, we, can only have it by having a close and rigid
analysis of our own conscious being, because we can
know nothing but our own consciousness; and if we
are to learn of the condition of Spirits in the other
world, that condition must be translated into our consciousness,
and we must find it therein recorded, or we
can only conjecture of their condition.</p>

<p>Then the first point to which I wish to call your attention,
is that which distinguishes the condition of
absolute consciousness from that condition which goes
to make up individuality—that which is universal and
applicable to all, and that which is only individual and
applicable to each and every individual. Every individual
has the means of determining how much of this
being—“I, myself”—belongs to the external and finite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
and how much to the internal and infinite; because
that which makes me to differ from you is finite; but
that which makes myself or yourself one and the same
with every other individual being in the universe, is
infinite. Therefore the first point of investigation is
to ascertain what it is that makes you and me differ
from every other individual being in the universe—in
what that difference consists—because when I speak
of you as a Spiritual being, I speak of you in view of
that difference, and not in view of that sameness.</p>

<p>You understand that individuality makes the difference
between us. My individuality makes me to differ
as an individual being from you. The question now
arises, what constitutes my individuality, this “I, myself”—what
enables me, when speaking of the events
Of childhood, to say, “When I was a child,” though
every thing has changed that pertained to my individuality
as a child—thoughts, feelings, tastes, pleasures,
form? What is it that connects the events of twenty
or thirty years ago with my present being?</p>

<p>I wish each one to go down into his own mind and
solve that problem, because if we are to talk about
Spirits we must learn about ourselves. When each
man understands thoroughly the Spirit that is at present
speaking to him, he will be able to form some
correct ideas respecting its condition in the Spiritual
world.</p>

<p>Upon examination, each will find that there is within
himself a principle of absolute consciousness—a principle
which is self-conscious, which represents itself to
itself, and is not represented by any thing but itself.
It can not be analyzed. It is absolute in itself. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
prove to you that your consciousness of identity has
undergone no change, I need but attempt to prove to
you that you are the same individual that you were
when a child, by referring to scars made upon your
fingers in childhood, which still remain, by calling to
mind traits of your childish character. All these
proofs you would consider very much inferior to that
proof afforded by an affirmation within you, which
rises above all outward evidence. It is that to which
the Book alludes when it says, “As he could swear by
no greater, therefore he swore by himself.” Although
in your physical, intellectual, and moral being you
have changed in every thing pertaining to your finite
consciousness, yet there is that within you which tells
you you are the same. Let one change follow another
to eternity, you will not lose your consciousness of
identity.</p>

<p>That which makes you differ from others does not
enter into this absolute consciousness of identity. In
other words, the thought, feeling, and affection which
characterized you at any particular time of life has
nothing to do with this absolute identification of self.
Nothing by which the world knows me, or by which
it knows you, enters in to form our inmost identity.
We have an identity which lies deeper than everything
external; and it is this identity, which admits of no
change, which says that we are the same, and will forever
remain the same identical beings to all eternity.
No change of position, no change of character, no destruction
of reputation, no conversion of happiness into
suffering, presents the least difficulty in the way of
identification. The man who has fallen, been ruined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
in reputation, and is steeped in suffering, finds no difficulty
in identifying himself as the same being who
was once good, respected, and happy. He does not
say that there was once a being who was happy and
good, but who has changed and become another being,
but he says that the character and position of this individual
identity has changed, while his identity has
undergone no change. I wish to call your attention to
that principle of absolute consciousness in you, by
means of which you know yourself, but by which nobody
else knows you. You know that that principle
in you does not constitute your individuality. It constitutes
your personality; but that in you which is
undergoing change, and develops from a lower to a
higher degree of knowledge, constitutes your individuality.
This unchanging, ever-present, conscious identity
is the very divine life within you, from which you
derive all life. This outside identity, which thinks and
wills, is no part of my immortal nature, separate from
this divine principle within me. This outside consciousness
can never be in any other state than the
finite. For wherever you have succession and duration,
you have time. Where you have succession in
extent, you have space. In regard to this outward
finite nature, one change follows another; and if change
follows change, there must, in respect to such change,
always be succession; and where you get succession,
you must necessarily have time. Hence the spirit, in
its finite nature, must always be in time till it shall
cease to change; when progress ends, time will cease
with the finite. This is a proposition so plain that no
mind can for a moment be lost in considering it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>We can form some definite idea of the Spirit-world
by first learning something of ourselves. You know
that this conscious principle within me and you knows
nothing about time or space. Suppose I instantly become
unconscious, and remain so twenty-four hours,
and am then suddenly restored to my consciousness.
During this twenty-four hours there has been no additional
record of events made within me; therefore
that twenty-four hours is obliterated so far as my consciousness
is concerned. I take up the time where I
left it. To the unconscious there is no time. To the
unchangeable there can be no time. Time is but the
marking of succession. The inmost principle by means
of which we become acquainted with ourselves, knows
nothing about time. When one is restored from unconsciousness
to consciousness, he knows instantly who
he is, but he can not say how much time elapsed to the
outward world. Clairvoyants who pass into a condition
of unconsciousness to all exterior things, have no
recollection of what occurs while they are in that condition,
though they may have been in it for several
hours.</p>

<p>I knew an individual once to be put into the mesmeric
condition, who was unconscious in his normal
condition of what occurred in the mesmeric state,
though he was in it for five hours, and during that
time performed many interesting experiments. At the
time of sitting down to be mesmerized he was in so
great hurry that he thought he could spend but a very
few minutes’ time. On being brought to consciousness,
he started off again in great haste, supposing that
he had sufficient time to attend to his business, show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>ing
clearly that he had not been in a condition to mark
succession of events.</p>

<p>The inmost principle of consciousness which identifies
me of to-day with what I was thirty years ago,
does not, of itself, notice time, except as it is connected
with this outward part of me. It counts time by
changes; but when you come into itself and separate it
from those changes, it does not know time at all. Between
my infancy and the present time it has been a
constant now. It is the presence of the infinite and
eternal in man, and the means by which he is connected
with the infinite and eternal. It is by the
presence of this infinite and eternal consciousness that
man knows that he possesses a finite and changeable
nature. It is a lamp within, which shines out and
reveals to him his finite consciousness, and the changes
transpiring there. So man has two selfhoods, an inward,
and an outward which is changing from day to
day.</p>

<p>When I speak of you as an individual being who
differs from me, I speak of your outward, changing
selfhood. But when I speak of you in your inmost
consciousness, I speak of you in your inmost selfhood,
in which you do not differ from me.</p>

<p>It is by this inmost consciousness that I know that I
am. It reveals myself to myself by just the same law
by which you are revealed to yourself. There are two
methods of addressing the outward selfhood—from
without, and from the infinite within. Where the individual
consciousness is addressed from within, the
communication is made to the affections, whence it
flows into the understanding. When it is addressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
from without, it is by representations of that which
addresses it. But when I go to the Spiritual world, I go
with this divine consciousness, this constant, unchanging
consciousness within, but not as a principle which
belongs to me, which is individualized within me. It
is just as universal as God. It is the divine consciousness
which is unindividualized within me, and wherever
that is, I must be, because of the ubiquity of this
divine principle. If there were any point from which
this could be excluded, and into which the individual
could be thrust, he would be annihilated.</p>

<p>What we need is to bring the external consciousness
into unceasing relation with this internal consciousness.
That which does not come into such relation
with this absolute consciousness does not become a
part of our finite selfhood—a part of our immortal selfhood.
Standing before you I perceive your countenances,
because your images are brought into a certain
relation to this absolute consciousness within me.
Now when they come into unceasing relation to this
unchanging consciousness, they become a part of my
external, finite selfhood. Memory is the result of
bringing events into such relation with this consciousness.</p>

<p>Looking at man, then, as possessing an absolute consciousness
which never changes, and an external consciousness
which is constantly changing, and which
alone causes one man to differ from his fellow, it is
apparent that if individuality is preserved upon entering
the Spiritual world, each must take with him so
much as causes him to differ from others. Whenever
this external nature would represent itself to another,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
not having a consciousness of its own separate from
the divine consciousness, it comes under the law of
exterior communication and representation. Therefore
it is never present in the mind by itself, but by
that which represents it there. If we would learn how
it is that a Spirit represents itself in different places at
the same time, we must learn the law of representation.
I see my audience, by which I mean I see that
which represents you to my consciousness. You are
presented to my consciousness by means of a medium
which comes between you and me; and according to
the accuracy of my faculties to perceive, and according
to the accuracy of this medium to represent you to my
consciousness, will be the accuracy of your representation
in my mind.</p>

<p>I see you now by the medium of light; and you all
see me at the same time. I am here and only here,
but you all see me in your various positions. You see
me by means of the light which takes my image into
every part of the room. Though actually present in
but one place in this room, yet by that which represents
me I am omnipresent in this room. The great
law of representation is that we perceive a thing, not
by itself, but by that which represents it in our consciousness.
Hence according to the ubiquity of the
medium will be the ubiquity of the representation.
In this room the medium light is ubiquitous, and my
image is just as omnipresent as the medium. The
same is true of every other medium by which presence
is represented.</p>

<p>I, as a finite spirit, am conscious only by means of
the divine consciousness within me, which imparts and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
reflects consciousness to my outward nature. My outward
consciousness is like the light of the moon, which
is the reflected light of the sun. The real consciousness
within me is that from which I derive my external
consciousness. Whenever I, as a spirit in my external
consciousness, would represent myself to you, I must
come into some medium of representation—some
medium which will be to my spirit what the light is to
my body. The medium of light will not represent me,
but there is a medium which will. This, the Spirit-medium,
is vastly more refined and ubiquitous than
light. Standing here as a spiritual form, and giving
off spiritual undulations, just as my body reflects the
undulations of light, wherever the Spirit-medium extends,
there my image will extend. And whenever an
individual comes into <i>rapport</i> with this spiritual
medium and sustains a certain relation to me, he will
be able to perceive my presence, because I am brought
to his view by that which represents me.</p>

<p>Many suppose that a person whose mind is separated
from the sensuous influences of the body, or brought
into the clairvoyant condition, can go to a distant
place, as to London, and see an individual to whom his
attention is directed. He tells me what the individual
in London is thinking and saying, yet hears what is
said to him here. If the individual in London were
to be thrown into the clairvoyant condition, and have
his attention directed to the clairvoyant here, the two
could readily converse together. Space is not noticed
by them, though it might be by carefully going over
the space and observing a succession of objects. Being
brought into <i>rapport</i> with each other, each can observe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
the thoughts and feelings of the other. This is done
by virtue of a simple law; and there is no mystery in
it. The medium which unites my organs of speech
with your organs of hearing, extends through the entire
room, and my voice is as ubiquitous as the medium
which communicates it. So in regard to this Spirit-medium,
which is the medium of communication between
the clairvoyants. By that medium, London,
Canton, or any other part of the earth, is present here.
Persons who mistakenly suppose that persons in the
clairvoyant condition leave their bodies and make
journeys to distant places, get up many curious theories
to account for the body and spirit being held together.
Their error arises from a mistaken conception
of the actual condition of a Spirit. You see readily
that a Spirit can be addressed externally only by that
which represents that which addresses it. Apply to
the case in hand the same law by which you see and
hear me, and substitute for the media of light and
atmosphere the Spirit-medium, and you will have no
difficulty in understanding how it is that Spirits can be
represented in different places.</p>

<p>Persons sometimes meet with difficulty in explaining
the apparent fact, that person in the form are
sometimes seen as though they were out of it. I recollect
several cases where persons were said to have been
seen and conversed with at places very remote from
each other; and it was supposed that the spirits left
their bodies and went to these distant places and represented
themselves. It is very easy to understand
how my spirit can appear in real Spirit-form and speak
to one a hundred miles away from here. It is done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
by what is called psychologic representation. If I
come into <i>rapport</i> with any mind yet in the body,
which mind is in <i>rapport</i> with me, I can create any
spiritual image in your mind that I may see fit to
make; that is, I can cause the image in me to reproduce
itself in you—so that that image in my mind shall
be reproduced in your consciousness, as the object before
the camera daguerreotypes its image on the prepared
plates. Now suppose that between us one or
more guardian Spirits are passing. The Spirit coming
into <i>rapport</i> with me, and having a full and perfect
perception of you, can, by the intensity of his
mental action, daguerreotype my image upon your
consciousness. You then perceive me by the psychological
action which that Spirit exerts upon your mind.
It is in this way that we can apparently meet and see
each the other’s form, just as though it were present.
But if we were more susceptible, there would be no
necessity of having the intervention of a guardian
Spirit. If we are both so developed as to clairvoyantly
perceive one another, the conversation can go
on, though both are in the body, and you in London
and I in New York. We see each other as though we
were present one with the other. It does not follow,
however, that my spirit is present in two places at the
same time; but that which represents it is universally
present. The question may arise, why we can not, upon
passing into the clairvoyant condition, see all the
Spirits in the universe—because they are all in <i>rapport</i>
with this spiritual atmosphere. I will explain. Suppose
we have ten thousand strings strung from the
ceiling to the floor, and they are made to give forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
certain sounds. Now all that have the same degree
of tension will give forth the same sound. The vibration
of one will cause all the others to vibrate which
have the same degree of tension. Take any stringed
musical instrument, and vibrate one of the strings. If
any other of the strings has the same point of tension,
it will vibrate. Now when my spirit comes in
contact with the Spiritual sphere and sustains the same
relation to any Spirit that the strings sustain to each
other, I can see that Spirit. Upon the same principle
I may see all who are in the condition to respond to
my spirit. When my consciousness will undulate to
their conscious vibrations, I perceive them, and not
till then.</p>

<p>If a Spirit is not present, except by that which represents
it, it will appear useless to open doors to permit
Spirits to enter, for a door is as transparent to the medium
by which they are represented, as a pane of glass
is to the medium of light. Jesus appeared in the midst
of his disciples, though they were shut up; and when
the time came for his disappearance, he ceased to be
seen, not by going out of the door or window, but by
disturbing the conditions by which he was represented
to their consciousness.</p>

<p>In respect of Spirit-mansions, etc., in the Spiritual
world, we are very liable to mistake representation for
actuality. We are very liable to mistake images of
things—creations, so to speak, proceeding from the
minds of the Spirits—for actualities. We are very
apt to perceive animals. Some think that animals
have a living form and exist in the Spiritual world;
but I pretend to say that it is not true. I know very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
well how they appear there. I know very well how it
is that persons suppose they do exist, and why Spirits
in the Spiritual world appear to have their dogs, cats—their
pet animals. To them they are actualities.
Nevertheless, I understand that the idea that a cat or
dog has an immortal soul is not only inconsistent with
any principle of philosophy in the universe, but is
contradicted by every principle of philosophy. To
say that a cat or dog is immortal is to affirm that to be
immortal which God himself can not make so. The
condition of immortality can not pertain to the mere
animal being. The representations of animals, forests,
fields, and things of this kind, have no basis upon that
which has a material or actual existence in the universe.
They are only developed under the law of representation.
Man has a sort of creative faculty, by
which he forms the images which are mistaken in the
Spiritual world for actualities. When Spirits are thinking
of animals they have seen in this world, they throw
out their images, and the individual who chances to be
in <i>rapport</i> with these Spirits sees these images, and
thinks they are actualities.</p>

<p>If you will only investigate the law of representation,
you will have no difficulty in accounting for these
things in the Spiritual world. Man makes these—they
are not real. God makes all that is real in the universe.
Man works in the sphere of representation, but
God works in the sphere of actuality.</p>

<p>Had I time, to-night, I should be happy to go into a
careful investigation to justify the conclusion that dogs
and cats, etc., are not immortal. There is no end to
be subserved in their being immortal. If the animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
were to go to the Spiritual world, there being nothing
to address his consciousness, he would virtually
have no being. Whenever a mind goes where its
consciousness is not addressed, it ceases to be mind.
If there is any place in the universe where consciousness
ceases to be addressed, there consciousness must
cease to be. What would there be in the Spiritual
world to address the consciousness of the animal who
has been developed only to the perception of physical
objects?</p>

<p>Again, between the nerve principle (the highest
principle developed in the animal) and the absolute or
divine principle, there intervenes the Spiritual principle,
which, being developed in man, makes him
receptive of the highest or divine consciousness, and
makes him immortal. The animal lacking this principle
can not be immortal. According to aspirations the
animal puts forth, according to its mental phenomena,
according to every principle, the animal is not immortal.
Nevertheless he has a representation in the
Spiritual world, according to the law of representation.</p>

<p>Every individual who is conscious of an existence as
an individual, has that within him which constitutes
him an individual; and as he goes into the Spiritual
world, he takes with him that individuality. This individuality
in its inmost joins upon the absolute, through
which it perceives its own consciousness, and by this
connection is unfolded in the facts, truths, and principles
of the universe.</p>

<small>ORGANIZATION—INDIVIDUALIZATION.</small></h2></div>


<p>The experience of man has been such, in respect to
organization, that all prudent and careful men and
women are beginning to have fears for the welfare of
a cause when it assumes the shape of an organization;
and they have just ground for fear; for the experience
of the past has been such as to justify them in supposing
that evils arise out of organizations. Their
tendency usually has been to beget a party feeling, or
that which corresponds in the organization to selfishness
in the individual. It is natural that every individual
should love himself better than others, and
when individuals associate together, they acquire a
spirit of individuality—a selfishness which pertains to
their particular society or organization. Individuals
who unite in religious organizations entertain a sort of
selfishness in reference to their particular denomination.
The Presbyterian, for instance, likes Presbyterians
a great deal better than Methodists, and the
Methodists likes Methodists a great deal better than
Presbyterians, and prefers to bestow his favors upon
Methodists. In fine, the general tendency of this kind
of organization is to lay in men and women the foundation
of a selfishness in addition to their natural or
individual selfishness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>There are many reasons for the evil results of organization;
and if we continue to organize upon the principles
observed in organizations of times past, we may
expect that the same evils will continue. I propose
to inquire whether there is not a natural basis, and endeavor
to discover the causes of evils for the past, so
that we may know how to rectify them and guard
against them in future.</p>

<p>Every operation in nature tends to individualism.
From the moment you begin to watch matter, every
process is found tending to individualization. The elements
which now compose our bodies originally existed
in a general unindividualized state or condition.
The material elements of our bodies, and the media
through which the material elements were controlled,
in bringing them to their present position, existed
originally in an unindividualized condition; and when
each particle was brought under a certain process that
it might receive vital affinities, it was with reference
to the formation of an individualism. Nature labors
constantly to organize and individualize, and you and
I owe our individual existence to this tendency in nature;
and the same law operates in society. The fact
that there have been so many organizations, shows that
there is a natural tendency to organize. The great
difficulty attending all organizations has been the departure
from the law of nature—the law of affinity or
attraction—for Nature works by the law of affinity,
never by the law of repulsion or excretion. The law
of excretion is only applicable to those elements which
are to be rejected. External force has never been applied
by Nature to aid her. She does not bring ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>ternal
force to hold the elements of the tree or rock
together, nor to hold together the organs of the animal.</p>

<p>Individualization is the result of an inward power
which attracts one part to cohere with its fellow. Nature
is very careful to observe the law of affinity; and
the moment you bring any element which should not
enter an organism, repulsion immediately operates to
prevent its entrance.</p>

<p>Hate is at times defined to be a less degree of love,
and love sometimes is very negative. Repulsion is
also defined to be a less degree of attraction. A stone
thrown into the air is drawn to the earth by the power
of gravitation. But the balloon which is subject to
the same law, instead of coming toward the earth’s
center, rises. It does not rise because the earth does
not attract it, but because the atmosphere, for which
the earth has a greater affinity than for the balloon,
causes the balloon to recede and make room for it.
The case of the balloon illustrates the law of excretion.
The position which each particle is to assume in
the system is determined by the vital affinities imparted
to it in the stomach. If any particle loses
its vital affinities, it occupies the position needed by
some other particle; and the new particle accordingly
displaces the old. But I wish to impress upon the
mind the fact, that Nature’s law of individualizing is
that of affinity, and that Nature does not apply external
force to build up her individuals. However, before
any particle can be taken into an organization by the
law of affinity, it must receive a peculiar impress or
affinity, and an affinity suited to the particular organization
into which it is to enter. It receives that affin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>ity
by passing through a natural process. If it enter
without a vital affinity, it will enter in as a stranger,
as a disturber of harmony; and the tendency of the
organism will be to reject and throw it off. What we
here learn from Nature, we may apply to organizations,
religious or otherwise. Each of us is a particle in society.
But before we can be organized harmoniously,
so that each shall be found in his specific place, each
must be prepared for that organism by receiving the
vital or spiritual affinity which is necessary for that
organism. You can not make A, B, and C into a
community unless they have the true impulse, any
more than you could go into the field and gather clay,
sand, etc., and mold them together, and make a man
or animal body. You can not hold men together in
an organization by outward restraint, and have them
fulfill the office of a genuine organization, suited to
the development of the spirit. The method by which
society seeks to organize itself is like the method by
which God created our first parents. Each individual
should be fitted to become a member of an organization
by being placed where he will receive the appropriate
vital affinity, and leave the affection of his nature
to point out his true position, whether that of head,
hand, or feet. The great difficulty in all past organizations
is that the natural law has not been observed.
Organizations have usually been formed with reference
to exerting force, either moral or physical. They have
organized by that which is external rather than internal.</p>

<p>The first requisite for an organization is a nucleus
of the character of the organization you wish, which
nucleus may consist of one, two, or half dozen indi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>viduals.
The individual who is seeking to establish an
organization must look for the nucleus in himself, not
in his neighbor. The idea of looking out of yourself
for an organization is all false. The idea that you
must look to a distance for some being out of yourselves
as a representation or reflection of the perfect
attributes of Deity, is erroneous. The individual who
feels the need of an organization must first understand
that that organization must be built up by the law of
affinity; and that as each individual becomes a particle
to be incorporated into the organism in his love and
affection, he must grow to retain his position. The
vital principle must be felt by himself. If he wishes
to redeem the world, he must commence by redeeming
himself. If he wishes help in redeeming the world from
its various evils, he must first find in himself that
spirit which he wishes infused into the helping association.</p>

<p>If a principle has not succeeded in saving me, I need
not hope that it will save the world. Therefore, when
we are about to organize a society upon any principle,
the first thing to be ascertained is whether this principle
has saved us. If not, we may just as well drop it.
If a person wishes to form an organization to make
the world Christian in faith and practice, you should
ask him if he has been made a Christian in faith and
practice. If he wants fidelity to truth and righteousness,
ask him if he is faithful to truth and righteousness.
Let the individual be tried by that which he
wishes to accomplish. If he can not stand the test, he
is not the proper person for a nucleus for such an
organization. Before one mourns over the lusts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
world, let him look after his own lusts. So in respect
to every thing necessary to make a truly upright man,
a man who shall live in all good conscience before
God and the world, and before the inmost of his own
soul. Let him see to it that after he has made a perfect
examination of his own breast, there is nothing
found lacking. Let him be so satisfied with his examination
of his own character, that he will be content to
have mankind redeemed up to the plane he occupies.
Then let his life be the incarnation of the principle.
Let the world, when they look upon him, be constrained
to say, “He has been with Jesus,” if Jesus is to be the
model of the church. Let his life correspond exactly
to the high and beautiful ideal of the church he is
wishing to have established; and then an influence
will go out from him which will become attractive to
all who, like him, are thirsting for that life. He will
find it unnecessary to throw out catechisms, because
there will be the true affinity which will come forth
from the character, and attract all who, like him, are
hungering and thirsting after righteousness. Form a
church by the application of external tests, and there
will be conflict all the time; while concord will characterize
one formed in accordance with the natural
principle of organization.</p>

<p>Spiritualists have become very numerous. I doubt
whether there is any other class of believers so numerous
as those now known as Spiritualists. They now
number millions, and they are men and women who
have come from under the restraints of authority—of
external law—a "thus saith the Lord"—and have
assumed the prerogative of acting for themselves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
One article of their creed has attached to them the
name of “Spiritualists”. They profess to believe that
our disembodied Spirit-friends are near to us, and hold
converse with us; and when any one says that he believes
in that, he is called a Spiritualist. That appears
to be the only test. But that external belief or assent
is not better as the basis of an organization than is the
creed, “I believe that God fore-ordained whatever
comes to pass.” The idea that such an assent could
be made the basis of an external organization is entirely
unnatural and supremely ridiculous. If you
should attempt to organize upon such a basis, you
would be guilty of the error into which all previous
organizations have fallen.</p>

<p>Many entertain the idea, that because we have overcome
our blind deference to authority, refused to be
ruled by the "thus-saith-the-Lord"—because we have
come to the conclusion to examine all questions for
ourselves—we have taken all the steps necessary for
our own reformation and that of the world. But what
has been the influence exerted by this new faith—New
Philosophy as it is sometimes called—upon the lives
and character of those who have accepted it. You
say, perhaps, that when you drive all the church
dogmas out of the way, there will be nothing in the
way of redeeming man. So far as you are concerned,
they are driven out of the way, and what has been
done for you? How much better are you morally,
religiously, than the man you call a bigot? You wish
all the world to be converted to a belief in the possibility
and actuality of Spiritual intercourse; but suppose
that all the world are converted to this faith,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
what are they to gain if it produces no better fruits
in them than in you? While we are trying to get the
motes from our religious brother’s eye, is it not possible
that we have very extensive beams in our own?
We are calling for organization to unite the moral
power and energy of the millions of Spiritualists; but
if the influence of Spiritualism has not served to redeem
us, how are we to expect that it is to redeem the
world? If <i>Spiritualism</i> does not save <i>you</i>, how are
you to reproach the church for its inconsistency in
sending its missionaries to convert the heathen to what
they themselves do not practice—when even slave-holders
are received to the bosom of the church,
while the slave toils in the rice and cotton swamps of
the South, while the babe is torn from its mother’s
breast. If the church were to turn round and point
out similar inconsistencies among Spiritualists, what
would the Spiritualists of New York reply?</p>

<p>Spiritualists should see to it that the work which is
wrought in them by Spiritualism testifies what will be
its work in others. If it does not touch their own
character; if it does not make the false man true, the
corrupt man better, what reason shall we give in favor
of its being received by the world? We have Spiritualists
enough to convert the world if they were only
<i>spiritualized</i>. There is the difficulty. It is one thing
to be a <i>Spiritualist</i>, and another thing to be <i>spiritualized</i>.
What we want is something that shall take our
Spiritualists and spiritualize them. We want to find
some key which shall open up a fountain deeper in any
man’s soul than has yet been opened by these manifestations—which
shall call out higher, holier, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
purer aspirations after eternal life than have yet been
called out. We all know this. We find every thing
on the right hand and the left to admonish us that
when the whole world shall have been converted to our
faith, it will be a bad world still. What then is needed
is, that you and I set about a work which is peculiarly
intrusted to us. We shall then redeem the world.</p>

<p>I must look for the coming of my Lord in my own
affection. He must come in the clouds of my spiritual
heavens, or he can not come for any benefit to me. I
must place myself in that condition that shall invite
him to come and reveal to me the way by which I am
to be redeemed; and then I shall learn the way by
which you and all mankind must be redeemed. When
all my falsehood, injustice, selfishness, lust, appetite,
and passion are dead, and when the God of heaven
shall live and work in me, then there will be laid in
my soul the foundation of that true spiritual affinity
which shall go forth, not seeking others to unite with
me, but, of its own plentitude, uniting with me those
who have the same affinity—uniting us stronger than
any creed. We shall not then be obliged to ask permission
to join or withdraw from such a church as we
should establish, but each man would join or withdraw
according to affinity or repulsion. Each man will
stand upon his own responsibility. I shall not be
responsible for you, nor you for me. I stand not here
to give you Christian character, nor you to give me
Christian character. Each man must have a communication
for himself with the Fountain of all love and
truth. We must all draw our water from the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
well, and it will become in us a fountain springing up
into eternal life.</p>

<p>Each must prepare himself for the kind of church
he needs. Let each seek to redeem himself. The
Spiritualists of New York and throughout the United
States will be ready to form a church just as soon as
they have prepared themselves to give forth the true
affinity; and you will find that it will not be necessary
to have any creed or catechism, any thing external by
which to try the faith of this or any other movement.
If you make up your mind to lead a true life, to speak
the truth, to be pure and just—if you make up your
mind that whoever comes within your influence shall
breathe in of your truth and righteousness—you will
find none will seek to come unto you unless they desire
to breathe that atmosphere.</p>

<p>The difficulty of the old organizations has been, that
no man or woman supposed it was necessary to make
themselves the representatives of that which they believe
to be necessary for the redemption of the world.
Their faith was not in their own righteousness, but in
the righteousness to be wrought in somebody else.
They worked to be righteous by proxy. They hoped
to be saved by the righteousness of another. Consequently
they organized upon an external basis, as their
organizations were not based upon a true affinity of
character. They did not understand that they must
possess the true character, consequently they did not
labor to attain it. The individual seeking to form a
church only labored to form a creed. He did not
suppose it necessary to form a character which he
wished to have infused into the church. The world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
however, can never be saved until the false opinion
that it can be saved by the righteousness of another
is done away. The world would put away its lusts,
appetites, and passions, were it not that it loves them.
Although they do not confer the happiness the soul
feels it needs, they confer more happiness than they
know how to obtain from any other source. Therefore
the world is not willing to put away its lusts,
appetites, and passions, and to become absolutely pure
and just; and if you will offer them a religion which
offers to save them from the consequences of sin, and
yet permits them to continue in their sins, they will
willingly pay for it, especially if its ceremonies and
the decorations of the church gratify the taste. If they
can have nice things in their churches, it is considered
nearly as good as to put them in their parlors. But
tell them these things will avail them nothing, that
they must love their neighbors as themselves, that they
must put away lust, appetite, and passion, and you
offer them a salvation they are unwilling to accept.</p>

<small>WHAT CONSTITUTES THE SPIRIT.</small></h2></div>


<p>The idea which has sometimes prevailed, that when
the spirit enters the Spirit-world it becomes divested
of certain states of affection, certain loves or delights,
and that it becomes so changed in its character or station
as to seek its delight in some other direction, is
very general among Spiritualists. They believe that
all our evil passions and affections pertain to this body,
and that when the spirit leaves it, his disposition to do
evil or to enjoy the fruits of his evil desires ceases.
Now, I wish to investigate this subject thoroughly
upon principles which commend themselves to every
individual’s consciousness.</p>

<p>That which constitutes me a conscious being does
not differ from that which constitutes you conscious
beings. So far as the element of consciousness itself
is concerned—so far as it enters into the mind—it is
the same in every individual. Your individuality or
mine does not consist in the fact that we are conscious,
and possess in ourselves a consciousness, but it consists
in that of which we are conscious. That which causes
me to differ from you is that which comes into a certain
relation to that consciousness.</p>

<p>This conscious principle within the spirit, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
in the body or out of it, is the Divine principle. It
is to this spirit what the sun is to the natural universe.
It is the light and the heat of the Divine sun shining
within the individual, revealing him to himself; so that
if we become familiar with this first proposition, so
that we understand one another, our deductions will
flow naturally, and we can understand perfectly
whether we are on the side of truth or not. Understand,
then, that it is not the fact that you possess a
consciousness within you, which causes you to differ
from me and every other being. We are all alike in
that respect. But when that consciousness begins to
shine out into your individuality, and look after your
thoughts and affections which have arisen out of your
individual development, and which have grown out of
individual relations peculiar to yourself, then this conscious
light and conscious heat, this conscious understanding
and affection within you, begins to reveal to
you your individual selfhood—that which constitutes
you an individual being separate from all other individual
beings. That which pertains to my character
pertains to my character as an individual being.</p>

<p>This individual affection which distinguishes me
from you belongs to my exterior or outer consciousness.
So then, when I speak of character, I speak not
of this inmost principle which has never changed, and
never can change, but will live on unchanged, because
self-existent and self-sufficient—not of the God within—the
Divine breath living in the soul—but of that
which is exterior of that which derives its life, understanding,
and perception from the light which this
absolute consciousness throws out. That which per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>tains
to my character enters into my individual and
finite selfhood; and it is by what is found there that I
am to judge myself, and the world is to judge me.
If you were to come to my inmost character, you
would then come at the absolute and infinite which exists
in me and in every other individual, without which
man could not be a conscious being at all. Separate
man from this conscious consciousness, and he would
cease to exist. It is by the harmonizing of his finite
perception with the infinite perception that he lives in
God and God in him. All there is of life, of conscious
being, is but a reflection of this absolute consciousness;
just as the light of the moon is but the reflection of
the light of the sun. Extinguish your sun, and your
moon could give you no light. Separate man from
this absolute consciousness, and he would have no finite
consciousness. Then that which constitutes you and
me conscious beings here and hereafter is not this absolute
conscious principle within, but that which comes
into unceasing relation to it, by which we are made
conscious of that which is.</p>

<p>I have thought, feeling, and affection, which pertain
to me as a finite physical being; and I am made aware
of that thought, that feeling, and that affection by the
presence of this absolute principle within me; but at
the same time they do not take their character from
this absolute consciousness. Hence we hear persons
talk about forming characters. But character is to be
considered in a double sense. All possess this inmost
character, and hence it is said that every individual in
his inmost is divine. But that Divinity, that God within
him by which he lives, and without which he could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
live, constitutes no part of his individual selfhood.
It is the Jehovah in the soul, by which he is revealed
to himself. That character in man, I grant, never
changes.</p>

<p>It is the external individual character to which I wish
to call attention in a special manner. Now that character
which makes me an individual being, and by
which I become wise or foolish, good or bad, true or
false, is constantly undergoing changes, and is developed
under laws growing out of relations which I sustain
to material and spiritual things and influences
which operate upon me from both the natural and
spiritual plane. This finite character is the one by
which I am to be judged.</p>

<p>I wish to examine man in his relations to the present
and the future, and ascertain, if possible, how much
of this finite character will continue with him after he
enters the Spirit-world, because upon this point there
is a great diversity of opinion. It is really one of the
vital points of Spiritualism. How, then, is this external
individual character unfolded? It depends upon
the ruling love in the individual, as well as upon his
intelligence or perception. We know that the individual
dwelling in selfish lust unfolds his selfish character
by doing that which he thinks will furnish him self-gratification,
and we determine his character by the
character of the impulse which governs him. The individual
who has known no higher impulse than this
desire for self-gratification, finds it impossible to conceive
that a person can act from a higher impulse; but
one who has experienced in himself a higher and purer
impulse than that which looks after self-gratification,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
can easily understand how it is that men and women
can act from higher impulses; but still he may not be
able to understand how they can act from an incorruptible
Divine love—love in its infinity, in its spontaneity,
going forth of its own Divine fullness, and
bestowing blessings upon all who come within its
sphere.</p>

<p>If we look out into society, we see individuals living
down in the lower departments of their nature. We
wish to reform them and mankind, and talk about
Spiritualism doing wonderful things for the world, by
way of breaking off the chains of superstition which
have bound people down in ignorance; we talk about
its removing that superstitious bigotry which causes
one man to persecute another for not thinking as he
does. We expect it is going to diffuse a liberalizing
influence, and thus <i>re</i>form the world. What do you
mean when you speak of Spiritualism reforming the
world? You mean that it is going to change the characters
of those living in it. You thus virtually affirm
that this external character that pertains to you, and
me, and all others, is the subject of change. We
understand, then, that your hope for the reformation
of the world is based upon the expectation that the
individual character shall be changed. And how are
you to change that character? You hope to change
the character of the unfortunate female, and place her
upon a higher and purer platform, by changing her
ruling love, correcting her false opinions and false
understandings—by having a purer affection to govern
her, and a higher understanding to direct her. You
hope to cause her to walk more in harmony with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
highest destiny. To persuade the inebriate to give up
his cups, you desire to create in him a love and respect
for the welfare of mankind—to implant in him a
ruling influence which shall elevate his character.</p>

<p>When you look at yourselves even, you see that
your character is undergoing a change. When a boy,
there were certain kinds of amusements in which I took
delight. Moral and religious exercises were nothing
compared with my hoop, top, etc.; but when I became
a man, and began to be manly in my aspirations, my
character had changed. So it has been with us all.
That within us which we call character, we suppose
must be forever subject to change. Each of us as we
progress, hopes to change, to become wiser, better,
purer. He who boasts that he has never changed his
opinion, virtually says that he has not progressed.
He who claims that he feels as he did twenty years
ago, boasts of his own shame. Our hope to progress
implies our expectation of change from that which is
false to that which is more true—implies a change of
this external changing principle within us, which constitutes
our individual character—our finite selfhood.</p>

<p>The question arises whether we shall take this distinguishing
character with us into the Spiritual world.
We need not be left to conjecture here, if we will
only enter into a philosophical examination of what
will constitute our character. You see clearly, that
what constitutes you an individual being here, is that
which is external to the absolute consciousness within,
and that when you lose this, you lose your individuality—that
if it should be absorbed, your individuality
would be gone, and you would be taken up by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
principle of general absorption, and would cease to
be as an individual being. But when you understand
that that which constitutes you a spiritual selfhood
pertains to your thoughts, your understandings, and
affections, and that nothing outside of your understanding
enters into that selfhood, in which you live,
and by which you know yourself, you will perceive
that if you do not take that with you to the Spiritual
world, you will take nothing with you that is yours.
If you leave that behind you, or so change it as to
make it represent another and not yourself, as a matter
of course, when you go to the Spiritual world, <i>you
do not</i> go there.</p>

<p>The idea has obtained to a considerable extent, that
this material body is the cause of our lusts, passions,
and appetites, and that these will die with it. It is my
opinion, however, that the body, so far as the matter
itself is concerned, does no more to degrade us or injure
us in any wise, morally, than does the matter
composing any other material substance. It has only
become an instrument receptive of certain conditions,
as the horse-shoe magnet has become receptive of certain
magnetic conditions. We talk about the attraction
of the magnet as though the attraction were in
the iron. But the attraction is between the positive
and negative conditions, which are present in the iron;
and when your bring the different parts of the iron
together, you bring the conditions which they contain
into proximity, between which the attraction exists.
So it is with this material body; it is made receptive
of conditions. The matter entering into this body
needs to go through a certain process, after it is taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
from the rock, before it is fit to enter into the human
system, because the matter which enters into the mineral
kingdom undergoes a certain change by which it
is fitted for the vegetable structure; and is then
brought into a certain relation by another principle
by which it becomes receptive of another condition,
which other condition is essential to it if it would
enter into or become receptive of the essential condition.
So that the particle of matter passing through
the vegetable kingdom passes through it for the purpose
of being made receptive of a higher condition;
and when it passes into the animal it has come into
relation to another power, called the nerve-power, with
which it was not in relation when in the vegetable
kingdom. It is brought under the influence of this
nerve-power, and made receptive of another principle.
And thus one particle of matter, in passing from the
mineral up to the animal kingdom, goes through that
elaborating process, simply because by being brought
into relation with certain media it becomes receptive
of certain higher conditions of which it was not before
receptive. The conditions do not change the character
of the matter at all. They pertain rather to the
spiritual than the material department of this being;
so that when my body is brought to a certain condition
of development, it becomes receptive by a sort of induction
of new conditions. Certain relations are established
between my body and spirit. My body depends
upon certain things for nourishment, and my spirit
depends upon my body for certain assistance. These
relations make my body subject to a law of consciousness;
but that law of consciousness does not pertain to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
my body. My body is but the instrument by which
that consciousness is acted upon from the external
world. When I experience pain in my finger from
placing it in the fire, it is not my finger that smarts,
but there is a consciousness in my mind which experiences
the pain, from the report of nerves which come
to the surface in my finger. Separate these nerves,
and I may hold my hand in the fire without feeling
the least pain; yet if the finger were pained, it should
feel as much after the nerves were separated as before.
Though the sensation appears to be at that point, it is
after all in the mind. The body is but an instrument
by which sensations of a peculiar character reach the
mind. Those who have had arms amputated, have
experienced pain seemingly in the fingers at times in
consequence of the exposure and irritation of the
nerves which go to the hand. It is sometimes conjectured
that they have spiritual fingers, but it is not so.
There are instances of persons experiencing pain seemingly
in the toes, after the leg has been amputated.
This is in consequence of the exposure and irritation
of the nerves which go to the foot. Furthermore, the
individual who has been mesmerized—who has had
his mind separated from the sensuous influences of his
body—may have his body dissected to pieces without
experiencing any pain, notwithstanding the least injury
done to the person who is in <i>rapport</i> with him will be
instantaneously felt, as though the sensation were in
himself. He can not be reached through his nerve-system,
but you can reach him through the nerve-system
of the operator, whose mental condition is impressed
upon him. The sensation, however, is in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
mind, not in his body, notwithstanding he locates it as
though it were in his body. Numerous other proofs
might be adduced to prove that though the body is the
means through which the mind is reached, yet the
sensation is all in the mind. Man makes use of his
body for the gratification of all his sensuous desires;
all of which originate in the mind. I do not deny,
however, that a sense of lack, not pain and disease,
may be induced in the body by certain courses of action—by
disturbing the nervous system. But that is
a thing entirely of itself. But there are other influences
originating in the mind, leading the individual
to seek gratification in horse-racing, gaming, sexual
indulgences, etc. In ten thousand instances the stimulating
influences to various acts arise in the mind, and
form a part of the mind. In the majority of instances
the body is simply made the instrument for the gratification
of lustful desires. Did the usual habits of
thought permit, it might be demonstrated, in various
ways, that lustful desires originate in the impure condition
of the spirit.</p>

<p>There are certain impulses pertaining to the body
<i>in its relation</i> to the body. An instance of such is the
sensation of hunger. I do not mean to say that the
body has the sensation of hunger, but that it is awakened
in the spirit by a demand which the body makes
upon the spirit for material to supply its need. There
are the sensations of thirst, heat and cold—diverse
sensations of this kind which come to the spirit through
the body. But that impulse which leads the individual
to seek gratification at the horse-race, the brothel,
etc., has its spiritual original, and flows out of the depraved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
condition of the spirit; and the body is not
responsible for it, though the body may be destroyed
by such impulse.</p>

<p>When we enter the Spiritual world, if we recognize
ourselves at all, we must recognize ourselves by that
which the absolute consciousness reveals to us. I do
not recognize myself by the principle of absolute consciousness
within me, but by that which it reveals to
me. When I go to the Spirit-world, I must take that
with me of which I must be conscious, else I shall not
take my individuality with me—else I become annihilated.
Just to the extent I leave my affections behind
me, shall I be annihilated as a spiritual being. When
I go to the Spiritual world, I must take my character
with me—that which is made an integral part of my
spiritual character by its development in me. Of
course, then, wherever I go that must go. The love
which rules within me must go with me until that
ruling love is changed, or until some holier love shall
call me to a higher plane of action. I am prepared to
maintain that when we go to the Spiritual world, we
shall take with us all the love, affections, thoughts,
feelings, and sentiments which characterize us as individual
beings. Every thing which causes me to differ
from you here will cause me to differ from you when
we enter the Spiritual world. I will retain my spiritual
selfhood by the same laws by which we maintain
our selfhood here. I believe the testimony of all
Spirits who have spoken to us concerning it, is that the
difference between the sensations here and there is so
slight that it is difficult to tell when one has entered
the Spiritual world. Many times have Spirits testified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
that they had to make many examinations after entering
the Spiritual world, to satisfy themselves that they
had left the body. That is, their sensations, thoughts,
feelings, loves, and affections underwent so slight a
change, they did not recognize any change in passing
to the Spiritual sphere.</p>

<p>If that individual Spirit changes his character there,
it must evidently be by some law operating upon character.
We know perfectly well that if you were to
bring an individual into New York who has been
given to a certain kind of pleasure, unless he can find
the same channel of pleasure here, he would feel miserable.
Let any one of you get in the habit of going
night after night to the theater, and you will by-and-by
acquire such a habit that you will be perfectly wretched
unless you can go there. You make resolutions to
break up the habit; but often break your resolutions,
and will feel miserable until some other love takes the
place of your love for theatrical amusements. The
poor drunkard often, in the midst of his dissipation,
resolves to put away his cup; but when again he
comes in the presence of the bottles and decanters, his
mouth begins to feel thus and so, and he can not help
drinking. The habit is so fixed upon him that he can
not break it up, unless something can implant a
stronger love within him.</p>

<p>As is our condition in this world, so is our state in
the Spiritual world. How often does an individual
feel that there would be no source of enjoyment for
him in the Spiritual world if he could not find certain
pleasures there. The beef-eater will continue to have
a desire for beef, unless some other gratification can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
come in to supply its place. So it is in reference to
every means of gratification. Upon the same law that
the good desire the good and true, would the individual
who has been a pleasure-seeker in this life seek in the
Spiritual world for his accustomed gratification.</p>

<p>In the Spiritual world the Spirits have the means of
gratifying their desires. Beef-eaters have the means
of gratifying their desires. Not that they have any
Spiritual beef. They have a mode of getting beef there
different from ours—namely, by representing it and
growing it on their own plantations. Spirits also enter
into their former pleasures by coming into <i>rapport</i>
with those here who have tastes like their own. If all
their passions and lusts are to be dropped, how are
those to know themselves in the Spiritual world who,
during a whole life here, have been dead to every
feeling and sentiment? Will they know themselves
by their truth and justice? They never had any.
How are they to know themselves, except by that for
which they were known here? It is evident that they
must carry their animal impulses with them. Gratification
for these impulses are procured by the law of
mental sympathy—the Spirits getting into <i>rapport</i>
with those on the earth who have desires similar to
their own, and taking thus the gratifications in which
they delighted while in the body. It is for this reason
that so many dark, benighted Spirits are found revealing
themselves to the world. I am aware that, in
these latter days, the idea has been advanced that
Spirits, when they leave this body, get rid of all this
filth. The truth is, the body was the cleanest part of
them here. The idea that when a Spirit leaves the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
body he gets rid of all his impurity, has caused many
to greatly venerate Spiritual communications, and
attach to them much authority. I remember that it
was with much deference that I listened to the first
communications which came from the Spirit-world;
but I very soon learned that a Spirit was not necessarily
wiser because of his separation from the body,
and that he required quite as much watching as one in
the body. Not that they are below the world; for
when you have taken an average of the justice and
wisdom of the world, you will find that the standard it
could set up would not be very high. When you look
over the earth and witness the very low state of character
of the human race here, why should you wonder
that Spirits of a very low character should hover
around us and manifest themselves to the world.</p>

<p>There was some philosophy in Dr. Beecher’s conclusion,
that the manifestations were Spiritual, but devilish;
for the majority of these manifestations come
from the very lowest Spirits. There is no use in denying
it. But the fault is all our own if a Spirit of
an undeveloped character comes in communication
with us and controls us; for I have power, which is
superior to all their finite power, to prevent their controlling
me. If I will live the life I should, I can be
protected from all such influences. If a Spirit of a low
character comes into <i>rapport</i> with you to control you,
it is your fault. It is because you are not in that true
condition of soul by which you come into <i>rapport</i> with
Spirits of a pure and wise character. It is nevertheless
unphilosophical for any individual to say that, because
there are low Spirits, he will have nothing to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
with Spiritual communications. It would be equally
unphilosophical to say, because there are good Spirits,
that all Spiritual communications should be received.</p>

<p>In respect of developing mediums, I wish to say,
that if they are to be developed for curiosity’s sake,
they had better remain undeveloped. But if it is desired
to bring them into conditions to redeem them,
it is all very well. But no person should permit himself
to become passive in his feelings and affections
while waiting for Spirits to come and develop him as
a medium; for in that condition he will be liable to
be influenced by bad Spirits. He may become the
instrument of one of the lowest and most debasing influences,
and may be influenced to commit the most
filthy and disgusting deeds. While the body should
be passive, the affections should be ardent, the soul
must send forth its most earnest aspirations.</p>

<p>You need not read from the Bible or the Koran.
What is needed is to keep your hearts right. Let the
aid for which you seek have strict reference to keeping
the affections right. We need to guard against being
influenced by those low Spirits who are waiting round
us to seek self-gratification. If you wish to commune
with Spirits, you yourself must determine what shall
be the class of Spirits with whom you will commune.
If you would commune with Jesus, you must come
upon his plane. If you would commune with the
Divine Father, you must become like him. You must
assume the character of the class of Spirits with which
you wish to commune. By observing this law we
need not have so much of this low manifestation. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
need a higher class of communications to convince
the world. The objections to Spiritualism is not that
there are not enough facts, but that their character is
such that the world is not willing to accept them.</p>

<p>“Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of
his own lusts.”—James <i>Letter</i>, chap. i. 14.</p>
</div>

<p>Lust may be defined to be the desire for self-gratification.
The forbidden fruit is that which seems to be
desired to make one happy, and is sought after, not
for the purpose of supplying a need, but to gratify a
desire.</p>

<p>Man’s constitution is such that there are needs pertaining
to every part thereof; and those needs are indicated
by awakening desires; and when the need is
supplied, a pleasure or gratification is experienced,
which is a sort of plaudit of “Well done;” and all legitimate
pleasure or happiness which man is constitutionally
fitted to enjoy arises from complying with the
proper demands of his being. All constitutional demands
of the being man have strict reference to constitutional
needs; and the life and energy making that
demand will not be disregarded. It will not suffer the
being to find rest until the demand is complied with.
It will create restlessness and disquiet; and the individual
will give expression to that life and energy in
some direction, if he does not in the true one.</p>

<p>Man possesses within him immortal energies, or he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
could not be immortal. He has that which is essentially
being and life, and which can not be destroyed.
Hence his divine energies will act with omnipotent
power to him, and he will be constrained to submit.</p>

<p>Here, then, is to be found the fundamental distinction
between true and false impulse—true and false
action. That impulse which arises within, indicating
a need of some department of our being, is true and
legitimate; and all proper action which tends to supply
that demand, without conflicting with any other
need, is true action. All other action and impulse are
illegitimate. The distinction between the two classes
of impulse and action is easily made, by an appeal to
our own consciousness. By a careful examination, we
can tell at once whether the impulse to perform any
act for ourselves arises from a sense of need or from a
desire of self-gratification; and whether the impulse
to perform any act for others arises from a near or remote
prospect of self-gain, or from a sense of fitness,
justice, or goodness of the act, in forgetfulness of separate
self.</p>

<p>In the very outset I postulate the following as undeniable
truth: All <i>true</i> desire in man has respect to a
need of some department of his being, which, when
truly supplied, will harmoniously develop him in respect
to every other department of <i>his</i> being, and
also in respect to all other beings necessarily connected
with him. That all <i>true</i> happiness or enjoyment
which he is capable of possessing must flow as
a consequence of truly supplying these needs; and
that while every need of his being is fully supplied,
he will be in the enjoyment of all the happiness he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
capable of desiring, and consequently will not desire
happiness on its own account.</p>

<p>I postulate further; that until every need is supplied,
man will feel a sense of lack, a desire for something
which he does not possess, the tendency of
which will be to stimulate him to activity in some direction;
and unless his activity is directed to the proper
supplying of the need, it will be misdirected, and will
tend to <i>deprave</i> rather than to <i>improve</i> his being.</p>

<p>Hence I postulate further, that when man feels within
himself a desire for happiness, he has demonstrable
evidence that these are needs of his being which have
not been supplied; and any attempt to fulfill his desire,
short of finding out and supplying the true need,
will be derogatory to his highest good and destiny, and
will consequently fail of conferring that which he
seeks, happiness.</p>

<p>I therefore postulate further, that happiness or enjoyment
is not to be sought; that if it come at all, it
must come unsought; that it is a necessary and inseparable
incident of the true life, by which is meant that
life which in its activity fulfills its every need. That
happiness which is sought after is never found, simply
because it is not an <i>end</i>, but only an <i>incident</i> of being;
and that while man is absorbed in the pursuit of pleasure,
he must necessarily be unmindful of his needs,
and thereby he will neglect their demands.</p>

<p>Here we have the foundation laid for examining the
distinction between the true impulse, known as love in
the various planes of unfolding, and that which is to
be characterized as lust. The true impulse is that which
indicates a need of some department of our being, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
which prompts to activity, looking to the supply of
that need, independent of any gratification which it
may promise. The false impulse is that which prompts
to activity, not in respect to any specific need, but in
respect to the gratification which it may afford. This
latter impulse is known as lust.</p>

<p>For the purpose of distinction I shall denominate
the true impulse, <i>love</i>, as being a manifestation of the
Divine Father’s wisdom and goodness, in whatever
plane it may be found; and I shall denominate the
false impulse, <i>lust</i>, as being a manifestation of that
which tends to lead to selfishness and antagonism, and
makes the interests of finite self overrule those of infinite
self, or the selfhood of the divine.</p>

<p>In the scale of being there is every plane of unfolding,
from the unconscious to the divine consciousness;
that is, there is every sphere of divine action and manifestation,
from the monad to the highest angel, and consequently
there are many degrees of love as the true
impulse to action. It has its sphere in the plane of
physical need, in the plane of intellectual and moral
need, and in the plane of religious need; and it is exalted
just in proportion as it approaches the absolute
or divine.</p>

<p>As there is a true impulse belonging to every plane
of unfolding, begetting the proper enjoyment in the
conscious plane when its demand is properly complied
with, so also is there every degree of lustful desire
seeking gratification in every plane, differing in grossness
according to the <i>means</i> by which it seeks its
gratification.</p>

<p>Reflection will satisfy every truth-seeking mind that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
desire for self-gratification, as an impulse to action, has
its basis in self; and, from its nature, makes itself the
center of attraction, and becomes a sort of an absorbent,
seeking self-appropriation; and whenever it makes
an expenditure, it is with respect to that which is to
return. And it never gives without the hope of receiving
in return a full equivalent.</p>

<p>This principle of action is from its nature finite and
antagonistic, upon the principle that that which it
seeks to appropriate to its own benefit and make its
own, can not at the same time be appropriated by
another; and hence the desire of self-appropriation
naturally leads the individual into antagonism with
others.</p>

<p>This finite and selfish impulse is the very opposite
of the infinity and unselfishness of the divine. Its
imperfect and antagonistic rule of action can not harmonize
with the perfection and harmonic action of the
divine. As the finite in every respect is the negative
and opposite of the infinite, so this finite impulse in
the individual is in every respect the negative and
opposite of the divine impulse. It is for this cause
that there is such an antagonism between the principle
of love and the principle of lust; an antagonism which
must continue until the divine shall bring all into subjection—until
the finite shall, in its principle of action,
harmonize in the infinite, or until God shall become
<i>all</i> in <i>all</i>.</p>

<p>Having already postulated that all true and legitimate
desire in the individual has strict reference to the
needs of the individual, independent of any promised
gratification, and that the gratification incident to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
supply of such needs was the measure of all true finite
happiness, I now proceed to illustrate this truth by an
appeal to the experience of all who hear me.</p>

<p>Happiness, in its general sense, is the fulfillment of
desire. And the more complete is the fulfillment of
every desire, the more complete is the happiness; and
happiness can not be perfect until every desire is fulfilled.
If in fulfilling the desire of one department of
our being we neglect the needs and consequent demands
of another, we may obtain temporary gratification,
but it does not answer the full demand of our
being so as to confer happiness. On the contrary,
while we gratify a lust, we resist a true demand, and
purchase gratification by disease and suffering.</p>

<p>The individual, ignorant or unmindful of the true
demands of his being, and intent upon self-gratification,
must forever fail of obtaining happiness, because
in his lustful pursuit he does not heed the real demands
of his entire being, and therefore he does not minister
to their needs; and hence can not obtain ease and
satisfaction. All pleasure-seekers can testify as they
have testified, that their pleasures are more in anticipation
than participation. Their happiness is in the
future, and seldom if ever in the present. The time
never comes when they find every desire gratified, and
consequently they are never quite contented, therefore
never quite happy. The very desire after happiness
is that which defeats it. The finite belongs to the
present; the <i>past</i> is his schoolmaster, teaching him in
the <i>present</i> how to receive the future. His duties and
needs are of <i>to-day</i>, and those which pertain to the
morrow will come on the morrow, not before. “Suffi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>cient
unto the day are the evils thereof,” and sufficient
unto the day are the <i>duties</i> and <i>pleasures</i> thereof. Man
can not take being and existence by anticipation,
neither can he take their true incidents in that way.
All anticipations of pleasure by which the individual
is made to live in the future, to the neglect of the present,
are lustful and illegitimate, and antagonize with
man’s true nature and destiny, and consequently tend
to defeat true happiness. That this is so, all human experience
affirms. That this must be so, the philosophy
of true happiness demonstrates.</p>

<p>There is no room for controversy upon this point.
It is most evident that true happiness can only flow to
the finite by fulfilling the true desires of the finite,
and that complete satisfaction can only take place when
every true desire or demand is complied with.</p>

<p>Now it must follow that every true desire is indicative
of a real need of the being in which it exists;
and consequently when every need is supplied, every
true desire must be gratified, and true happiness must
be the result. And as every need has respect to that
which pertains to the <i>present</i>, every true desire belongs
to the present, and asks present fulfillment.</p>

<p>From considerations of this kind it becomes evident
that anticipated pleasures are illegitimate, and
belong to the school of lusts, and do not tend to beget
true happiness; and that just in proportion as the individual
is absorbed in the anticipated pleasures or duties
of the morrow, he is disregarding the true law of his
being, neglecting present needs, and laying the foundation
for defeating the very end he seeks. Man, as a
physical, intellectual, moral, and religious being, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
needs pertaining to each and every department thereof,
and consequently in supplying these needs he becomes
receptive of pleasure from every department of his
being. When he is truly and harmoniously unfolded,
all his needs are orderly and harmoniously set forth;
and when he truly complies with their demand, his
delights or gratifications blend or flow together in one
harmonious stream, and his whole soul is filled with
the divinest melody, instinct with the <i>present</i> God.
But note, the moment he neglects a single need, or
misdirects the energies of his being, there is not only
a strain which is not represented in the choral anthem
of God, but it is caused to vibrate discordantly with
those strains which are represented, and instead of a
soul pulsating with the divinest melody and joy, you
have it harshly jarring to the discordant notes of antagonism
and death.</p>

<p>The principles of this philosophy affirm that man
must attend to the needs of every department of his
being, if he would develop harmoniously. The Divine,
in the plenitude of his wisdom, has given to man
nothing superfluous. His physical body, with its
needs, is just as essential to the perfect man as is his
spiritual being; and its demands are as imperative in
their sphere. And man is as really obeying the Divine
in truly administering to his physical as to his
spiritual needs; and the pleasures attending the true
administration are as true and just in their sphere as
are those pertaining to more exalted spheres of being
and action. He who despises and afflicts his body to
benefit his soul mistakes the divine order and method,
and in afflicting his body wars with the true interests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
and destiny of his immortal being. The disposition to
afflict the body for the benefit of the soul is that higher
manifestation of the selfish and lustful principle turning
its weapons purposely upon itself. Its aim is self-gain,
and, through that, self-gratification. Hence the
cloistered nun, the solitary monk, and the stern ascetic,
of whatever school, are violating the divine method
and law as much as is the pleasure-seeking worldling.
They are as really under the dominion of their lusts
for self-gratification as any other class. Their expenditure
of worldly pleasure has respect to the spiritual,
which they hope thereby to obtain; and, like any other
selfish being, they only act with respect to some expected
gain, bringing with it enjoyment or gratification.</p>

<p>The great error of the world is that it does not distinguish
between the true and false impulse, giving
rise to true and false action, out of which grows true
and false development, bringing existence into antagonism
and false relation.</p>

<p>Said the Divine Teacher, speaking of little children,
“Of such is the kingdom of heaven.” The infant at
birth instinctively obeys the law of its being, and it
continues to do so in every department of its being
which does not come under the rule of its conscious,
voluntary action. When it feels the demand for food
to nourish and develop its infantile body, it indicates
that demand by its restlessness and complainings; and
when the demand is supplied, its complainings cease.
It does not ask for gratification beyond the supply of
its needs; <i>that</i> it does ask for, and must have to give
it quiet. During this early period it eats to live, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
continues to do so until, by its development, another
nature with its needs is brought into conscious existence,
and neglected. Then the unsatisfied demands of
that other nature impart disquiet to the being, and he
begins to search after gratification. It is in this way
that lust is begotten. It is never felt until the demand
of some need is neglected, and it is an immutable law
that such neglect must beget lust; and hence whoever
feels the demand for gratification of any sort hears the
voice of God within proclaiming a neglected demand,
a perishing need. He sees the cherubim of God standing
at the gate of Paradise, with a drawn sword of
flame turning in every direction, guarding the tree of
life. Thus man’s lusts proclaim his imperishable needs,
and, when truly understood, they are but the echo of
God’s voice calling upon him to return and live.</p>

<p>The child naturally comes under the dominion of its
lusts through ignorance. It feels the disquieting influence
of its neglected needs; it feels discontented and
unhappy, and therefore it seeks gratification in such
direction as experience has taught it it might sometimes
be found. He early learns the pleasures of
sense. He could not comply with the demands of his
physical nature without knowing them; hence, when
he feels a demand for something—he does not know
what—what more natural than that he should seek
sensual gratification. Thus it is according to the figure,
that man partakes of the forbidden fruit before his eyes
are opened to know good and evil. His first disobedience
is in consequence of his ignorance of the nature
and requirements of his needs; and, seeking to obtain
gratification, he violates the true law of his being.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
But as man has needs pertaining to his physical, intellectual,
moral, and religious natures, and as there are
pleasures pertaining to the proper supplying of them,
man’s lusts may lead him to act in either the physical,
intellectual, or moral and religious departments; and,
as already remarked, the <i>grossness</i> of the lust will depend
upon the plan and the means by which it seeks
gratification. Reflection will demonstrate that the
different lusts, as they are called, differ not in the primary
impulse, but differ in the manner of seeking
gratification. Man, in the external and finite of his
being, may be differently affected by the different
modes of gratification which his lust prompts him to
seek. Thus the physical effect produced upon him by
seeking gratification through his appetite for strong
drink, will be different from that produced upon him
by seeking gratification through his relish for food or
social amusement. Seeking gratification through the
improper exercise of any of the faculties of the body
or mind tends to produce injury in two ways.</p>

<p>First, the tendency is to call off the attention from
the actual needs of the being, so that the proper
demands are neglected, and thereby lustful desires
become intensified by the influx of an unnatural degree
of energy in that false direction. And second, by overtaxing
the capacity of those organs which are used for
lustful gratification. Thus the inebriate and glutton
who make use of their appetites as a means of gratification,
often weaken and disease the organs of digestion
and assimilation, and thereby disqualify them for
performing their proper functions. Man can not engage
in lustful exercises without subjecting himself to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
these twofold evils. And their manifestation will be
according to the plane of the lust and the means adopted
for its gratification. But while lusts differ thus in
their modes of expression, as well as in their primary
and secondary effects upon the individual, they are all
alike in their inception, and in the end sought to be
attained. They all have their beginning in the neglect
of some need, which creates a sense of lack, and they
all seek self-gratification irrespective of such need; so
that all lust, in whatever plane found, is alike in its
origin and end. All are fatal to true happiness.</p>

<p>The general sameness of character of all lusts accounts
for the singular compounds and apparent incongruities
of character found in certain individuals. That
is, it is not unfrequent to find individuals remarkable
for their zeal in politics, morals, and religion, carried
away at times by the grossest lusts. Men, eminent for
their piety, sometimes have been notorious for their
intemperance and lewdness; and the world have been
astonished at it. But a careful attention to the distinction
to be made between the true impulse and lust
soon solves the mystery. Such men are pre-eminently
under the influence of lust in every department of their
being—in the moral and religious as well as in the
physical. The piety of such men may be ever so deep
and earnest, yet its basis is in use. They see nothing
in the Divine character or perfections which excites in
them love or admiration any further than it is to bear
upon their own well-being and happiness. Their love
of God is a love of the instrument or means by which
they are to become supremely blessed. And their
love, after all, is a love of their own happiness, and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
God as essential to their happiness. If they should
discover that God stood in the way of their future enjoyment,
they would like him no better than any other
enemy.</p>

<p>Such minds mistake lust for love, and in seeking
their own happiness call it seeking God; and in rejoicing
in their anticipations, call it rejoicing in God.
The man that seeks religion for the sake of securing to
himself salvation and endless delight, is just as lustful
and selfish as he who seeks gratification in any other
way. Man may go a whoring after strange gods as
well as after strange women.</p>

<p>Those who appeal to men to get religion in order
that they may escape misery and secure happiness,
appeal to their lusts, and so far as they influence them
by their appeals to their hopes and fears, they stimulate
them to lust. The individual who seeks religion
for the purpose of saving his soul, is exercising the
very impulse which most of all tends to defeat his salvation.
Hence said Jesus upon this very point,
“Whosoever seeketh to save his life shall lose it,” etc.
The very impulse is as selfish and undivine as possible.
It is for this very reason that the influence of the popular
religions of the day is not redemptive in its character.
To say to the world that when all should be converted
to the religion of these fashionable churches,
the millennium would come, would provoke in the
highest degree their sense of the ludicrous. Their
lustful seeking after self-gratification is so apparent
and gross, that they can not even deceive themselves.</p>

<p>It will not be considered a false declaration when I
say, that there is no possible resemblance of character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
or practice between these modern fashionable Christians
and Jesus of Nazareth. The redemptive principle
of the religion of Jesus can not be found in their
religion. The difference is, Jesus was seeking the
kingdom of heaven and its righteousness, while they
are seeking self-gratification. The impulse in Jesus
was that of religious love; theirs is a religious lust.
The impulse in Jesus led him to hunger and thirst
after righteousness; theirs leads them to hunger and
thirst after the things of sense. Jesus, in the things
pertaining to the world, was the Lazarus; they are the
Dives.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I must be permitted to say that the
popular religions of the day are manifestations of man’s
lustful character, in the moral and religious plane;
and that it is more difficult to reform a man in his
moral and religious lusts than it is in his animal lusts.
It was for this reason that Jesus pronounced his severest
woes upon the Scribes and Pharisees, who thought
they were righteous and who despised others. Hence
he said to them, “Ye shut up the kingdom of heaven
against yourselves.” Also, “The publicans and harlots
do pass into the kingdom of heaven before you.”</p>

<p>The proposition reduced to its simplest form is this:
True religion can not dwell with lust. “Ye can not
serve God and mammon.” But the religion of the
Pharisee of every age is lust in its highest and most
impregnable plane. Hence the more of such proposed
religion they have, the farther are they from true religion.
Jesus was condemning lust in the moral or
charitable plane when he directed that alms should be
done in secret. The impulse to charitable deeds which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
looks to self-gain or self-gratification, brings no reward
to the soul of the giver. If he is prompted by a desire
after fame, or from a hope of inward satisfaction, he
does not act from the true impulse. He who sounds
the trumpet in the world or in his soul, to call attention
to his charities, can have no reward of his Father
in heaven. He who acts from the true divine impulse
acts spontaneously, acts as it were involuntarily; that
is, he is not aware that he wills. His left hand knows
not what his right hand doeth. He meets with a case
of need. He stops not to argue the question and determine
probabilities and uses. The steel and the flint
are in contact, and the spark, comes forth.</p>

<p>In the domestic relation of husband and wife, parent
and child, brother and sister, there is much of this
moral lust which is mistaken for love. Many professing
to be husbands, and really thinking themselves to
be so, love the <i>use</i> of their wives better than the wife,
just as the lustful in religion love the <i>use</i> of God better
than God.</p>

<p>It is this mistaking <i>lust</i> for <i>love</i> which begets so
many unhappy marriages. The considerations leading
to the union are not unfrequently of a lustful character
altogether. Thus the young man seeking a wife is
constantly trying the question of use. She will administer
to his comfort in this way and that, and upon
the whole she will be the means of making him very
happy. It will not be denied that in a vast majority
of cases the man, in seeking a wife, is seeking after his
own happiness, and he will cherish her while she conduces
to that end. But if he finds himself disappointed—finds
that she fails to fulfill his expectation—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
ardor of his love begins to abate; and just in proportion
as he is disappointed in his expectations will he
grow cold and neglectful. So common is this that it
has arrested the attention of universal man. The difference
between the fondness manifested while yet the
newly-wedded pair have met with no disappointments,
and that which is manifested a few weeks or months
later, has given rise to the expression "<i>the honey-moon</i>,"
meaning that the age of a single moon is usually sufficient
to reveal the imperfections of the loving pair, and
consequently to cause the ardor of their love to abate.
The husband does not find in the wife all that he
anticipated. She is not so perfectly adapted to making
him happy as he had hoped. Consequently he is disappointed.
And as his happiness was the object of
his pursuit when he was seeking a wife, and he mistook
that lust for self-gratification for love for the
wife, being disappointed in his lust, he finds little or
nothing of love left.</p>

<p>It is thus, by mistaking lust for love, that so many
disappointments take place, and so many unhappy
unions are formed; and while the individuals are
under this lust for self-gratification, there is little hope
of their doing better a second time. It was in reference
to this lustful and selfish love that Jesus said
unless a man loved him or his doctrines with a better
and purer love than that with which he loved wife,
children, parents, etc., he could not become his disciple.
The simple truth of the expression was, that
man’s love, or the love of the world, was lustful; and
unless man loved God and truth with a purer love
than that lustful love, he could not be a true disciple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>The same lustful impulse is found in the parental
and fraternal relation. Man is so naturally selfish and
lustful, that it is found in every relation, leading him
into the broad road to disobedience and sin. And
herein is manifested the deep excellence of the morality
of Jesus, that it aimed a fatal blow at the lust
itself, and thus “laid the axe at the root of the tree.”
“His fan was in his hand, and he thoroughly purged his
floor,” “gathering the wheat into the garner, and
burning the chaff with unquenchable fire.”</p>

<p>In man’s social relations the same lust after self-gratification
is found. The friendships of the world
have this lustful basis, and herein are they distinguished
from true friendship. The selfish man or woman seeks
social and friendly intercourse for the pleasure or gratification
it affords. They cultivate social and friendly
relations solely with respect to the pleasures thereof.
Consequently their love of <i>friends</i> is only in their <i>use</i>
to them. They love their own gratification supremely,
and they love the use of that which will administer
thereto—consequently their attachments turn upon the
question of gratification. They do nothing, they love
nothing in forgetfulness of separate self.</p>

<p>This distinction between true love and lust is to be
made in every plane. The true impulse in every plane
is the manifestation of the present God in that plane.
The obeying that impulse is obeying God. The harmonizing
with it is harmonizing with God; and the
individual who in all things walks in accordance with
its principles is walking with God, and is in the straight
and narrow path which leadeth unto life; while he
who, on the contrary, is led by his desire after self<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>-gratification,
in whatever plane, is in the broad road
which leads to antagonism and death. “His lusts,
when they conceive, bring forth sin; and sin, when it
is finished, bringeth forth death.”</p>

<p>There is no middle ground between <i>love</i> and <i>lust</i>;
and unless the distinction be taken where I have taken
it, it can not be taken at all. Excuse the principle of
seeking after gratification as a true incentive to action,
and you have destroyed the distinction between purity
and impurity—between truth and falsehood—between
holiness and sin. If action in respect to use and the
gratification of self be the highest, then, indeed, there
is no God—no virtue—no right. Such is the ultimate
conclusion of those who know of no higher rule of
action than pertains to the sphere of use and gratification.
They know of no intrinsic virtue, goodness,
purity, etc. They affirm of existence the qualities of
good or bad from results. They say that a thing is
right or wrong because the result is wrong, and not
that the result was wrong because the thing itself was
intrinsically bad.</p>

<p>This is a very common error with the world. They
are apt to trace the evil in the result and overlook it
in the cause. The reason that lustful action is pernicious
is not because its results are bad, but because
the condition itself is intrinsically false, and can not
produce other than false fruit.</p>

<p>We sum up in this. Man will never feel the need
of that which he does not lack. He will never feel
the need of happiness or gratification so long as every
demand of his nature is gratified; because the compliance
with every demand of his being will of itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
confer all that he can desire, and he will be satisfied.
Hence the desire for that which he does not possess
demonstrates that there are true and just demands of
his being which are not complied with.</p>

<p>Therefore any attempt to satisfy that desire, short of
complying with the true demand, will result in begetting
false action, which will tend to overtax and disease
some part of his organism, creating an unnatural
demand in that department, which, instead of bringing
satisfaction and content, will bring restlessness
and disquiet, calling for still further gratification.
Thus lust, when it is conceived, bringeth forth a violation
of the normal or healthy condition, which is sin;
and that sin in its work, when finished, bringeth forth
death.</p>

<p>“Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the
prophets. I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.”—JESUS’
<i>Sermon</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>MAN, as a finite and relational being, is the subject
of government. Being produced and developed by
laws acting to certain ends, he is the subject of such
laws. Being receptive of influences out of himself, he
is subject to such external influences, through their
action upon his conscious perceptions and affections.</p>

<p>Man, as a conscious being, is the subject of two
classes of impulses. One is a sense of affinity, the
other of restraint. The first is the natural impulse
proceeding from certain relations, and is a spontaneous
proceeding from such relation without considering
consequences. The other is a reflex impulse proceeding
from supposed consequences which will follow certain
conditions and actions, and has respect to ends or
uses.</p>

<p>This latter class of impulses makes him the subject
of outward motions, and bring him under the dominion
of laws external to his being. As such he becomes
the subject of an external government. As a conscious
being, man is the subject of two classes of
external government, the one which appeals to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
selfish and lustful nature, and the other which appeals
to his moral and relational nature—and he is the
proper subject of the one or the other government,
according to the character of his ruling affection or
love.</p>

<p>Man, as a conscious being, can be governed only
through some department of his consciousness. That
which induces in him volition must address his perceptions,
and proceed thence to his affections. For man’s
affections can not be approached externally except
through his perception. This is most manifest to the
reflecting mind. Before an individual can love or
hate an object, he must be able to perceive it. And
his love or hatred thereof will be according to his perceptions.
Hence it will be perceived that the individual
who is in the ruling love of self, if governed at all
as a conscious being, must be governed by an appeal
to his selfish nature; that is, by an appeal to his hopes
and fears. For so long as he is not under the rule of
his moral nature, he can not be governed by its influence.
If man is to be controlled, he must be controlled
by controlling that which controls him.</p>

<p>The selfish and lustful man is under the dominion
of his selfish nature, and whatever controls that nature
governs him. And he can be governed, as a lustful
being, only by controlling his selfish nature. The same
is true in principle of the moral man, or he who is
under the dominion of his moral nature. Whatever
controls the moral nature governs him; and so long as
he is under the dominion of his moral nature he must
be so governed. Thus it will be perceived that our
proposition is true, that man, as a conscious being, must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
be governed through that department thereof which
rules in him. If it be the selfish, he must be governed
by an appeal to selfishness; if it be charity or moral
love, then that nature must be appealed to.</p>

<p>Since, then, man must be governed by an appeal to
that impulse which rules in him, and since mankind
are naturally under the selfish impulse, the first government
to which man becomes subject naturally is
that of force; and it appeals to his hopes and fears—that
is, to his selfish desire for gain or happiness, and
his dread of suffering and loss. Hence <i>selfishness</i> is
the basis of the first dispensation of government. This
dispensation of government is not calculated, nor is it
designed, to make the comer thereunto perfect. Its
end and use is to protect the individual from external
or outward evils, and not from that which comes from
within. It can not extend beyond the cleansing of the
outside of the cup and platter.</p>

<p>The most this kind of government can do is to
restrain man from depredating upon the rights of his
neighbor, by an appeal to his selfishness. Hence the
language of the law pertaining to this kind of government
is,“eye for an eye,” “tooth for a tooth,” “life
for life,” etc. It does not propose to govern man by
appealing to his sense of justice and his love for right.
On the contrary its language is, man has no sense of
justice or love of right. He is selfish and sensual,
and therefore the law appeals to his selfishness and
sensualism. It says, Your love of your neighbor is not
sufficiently strong to prevent you from injuring him,
but your love of self is sufficiently strong to prevent
your injuring yourself. Therefore says the law, if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
injure your neighbor, we will injure you; if you kill
your neighbor, we will kill you; and the same blow
which you aim at your neighbor, we will cause to fall
upon your own head. In this way this first kind of
government takes advantage of man’s selfishness to
restrain him. It does not cause him to love his neighbor.
It does not cause him, from his heart, to respect
his neighbor’s rights. It does not tend to lesson his
selfishness or lust. It does not in any manner tend to
make him more true, just, and pure at heart. It only
restrains him from giving expression to his selfish and
lustful desires.</p>

<p>So far as his motions to action are concerned, he is
under the same impulse, whether he keep or break the
law. He is as righteous at heart in violating its commandments
as in observing its requirements. In either
case he is governed by his judgment respecting that
which pertains to his self-interest, and in keeping the
law he is consulting his own gratification, and in violating
it he is doing the same.</p>

<p>So far is this kind of government from tending to
make the individual better at heart, that it not unfrequently
makes him more selfish by intensifying his
selfish feelings. The individual who is restrained from
stealing through fear of punishment, and not from a
love of justice, is a thief at heart, and will continue
so notwithstanding the law says, “Thou shalt not
steal,” and by its penalties deters him from stealing.
His neighbors may thank the law for its protection.
But that is the end of its use. It will not
improve the <i>moral</i> condition of its subject.</p>

<p>Such, then, is the nature and use of this just dispen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>sation,
sometimes called the first covenant. It is absolutely
indispensable for the protection and preservation
of individuals and society. Man left to the
unrestrained exercise of his lustful and selfish nature,
would not only destroy his neighbor, but he would
ultimately destroy himself. And thus the very principle
of self-protection compels individuals to associate
together under these governmental forms, by means
of which the weak are to be protected against the encroachments
of the strong, the simple against the
machinations of the cunning.</p>

<p>This necessity gives rise to institutions among men
which are designed to direct the <i>manner</i> of applying
this power to the protection of those who institute them.
The laws of these institutions are but the expressions
of the intellectual and moral character of those who
make them. Their wisdom is displayed in adapting
the means by which their united force shall be directed
to the execution of the governmental will, whether
that be just or unjust.</p>

<p>The uses of these external governments are most
apparent; by which I mean their uses as a means of
protection. The highest possible use of governmental
institutions is that of uniting and directing its force to
prevent the weak from becoming the prey of the strong,
and the simple the dupes of the cunning. If every
man or human being had the means of self-protection
always at hand, or if none were disposed to encroach
upon the rights of others, but were disposed to do good
to all rather than evil, then there would be no occasion
for governmental institutions. So we see that the uses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
of institutions, as means of government, have respect
to the concentration and direction of force.</p>

<p>But as the selfish man can be governed only by an
appeal to his selfish nature, and that must be addressed
through the motives of hope and fear, these institutions
of government, addressing man’s hopes and fears, are
indispensable for the well-being of society, and can
never be dispensed with until man is elevated to a
higher plane, and made the subject of a higher government.
In other words, this kind of government must
never be taken from man, but man must be elevated
above, and thus be taken from the government. There
have been two opposite errors respecting this kind of
government: one declaring it to be ordained by God,
and therefore to be observed and obeyed as an exponent
of the Divine will and character; the other holding
that all governments of force and blood are contrary
to Divine appointment—both of which doctrines
are true when viewed in a proper direction, and false
when viewed in the opposite one.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is according to Divine appointment
that man, as well as every other finite being,
shall be governed according to the law of the plane in
which he exists and acts; because every thing existing
in a finite and relational sphere must become the
subject of some law, or it could perform no mission in
respect to itself or any other existence. Without law
it could not be saved from utter destruction. And
being the subject of law, it must be the law of the
plane in which it exists and acts; hence whatever may
be the law of that plane, it is one of Divine appointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>Man living in the plane of selfishness and lust must
be governed by the laws of that plane; he can be
governed by no other. Hence the law of that plane
of sensualism requiring “eye for eye,” “tooth for
tooth,” “life for life,” etc., is a law of Divine appointment
for that plane; and whoever descends into that
plane of impulse, and lives there, becomes subject to
its law. Having yielded himself servant to obey his
selfishness and lust, he has become the subject of its
laws. Having taken the sword, he is subject to its use.
Having appealed to force, he must be sure to be on
the strongest side, or he will be likely to be crushed.</p>

<p>But while the law of selfishness and force is one of
Divine appointment, in the sensual plane, it must not
be understood as giving law to any other plane. If
the law of “eye for eye,” “tooth for tooth,” etc., was
applicable to the dispensation of sensualism, which
the Mosaic represents, it does not follow that it is the
true law of the Christian or Spiritual dispensation;
and he who appeals to such laws of the Mosaic can
have the benefit of them by containing under that
kind of government. But he must remember, if he
wishes to obtain the benefits of the Christian dispensation,
he must “put away the old man with his deeds.”</p>

<p>Hence, according to the teachings of Jesus, he who
would become his disciple must rise above the plane
of sensualism. The new law under which he was to
come demanded that the law of force should be discontinued.
If he would have the benefits of the kingdom
of heaven, that is, of the government pertaining to
the moral and spiritual plane, he must not resist evil
by force; he must not smite back when smitten; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
must not indulge in feelings of hatred or unkindness
toward any one; he must love his enemies; bless them
in the midst of their cursings. He must be pure in
heart; he must hunger and thirst after righteousness;
he must, in all things, be under the dominion of a
love, pure, holy, and unselfish. Such a one would
be freed from the law of sin and death; such a one
would cease to be a debtor to the law of the first dispensation,
and would be born into liberty, not into a
liberty to do wrong, but a liberty which had respects
to his purified affections.</p>

<p>This will be understood by contrasting the principles
of the two dispensations. The first governed by a
force external to the subject, constraining him as a
selfish being to do things not agreeable to him, thus
bringing his will into subjection. The second governed
by implanting the true affection within the subject,
so that his delight was in the law, according to the
inward man. Hence the new kingdom was to be
“within.” The first was over man with force and
fear; the second was to be within man with charity
and love.</p>

<p>From this it will be seen, that the first government,
or covenant, as it is called, necessarily required external
institutions to beget and direct its force to compel
obedience to its enactments and edicts. And these
institutions were necessarily authoritative; and persons
belonging to their plane of administration were
compelled to submit to them, as to the authority of
God.</p>

<p>The second government or covenant which ignored
force, and governed by love, had no use for such institutions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
and hence returned the sword to its sheath.
Under its administration, swords were to be beaten into
plowshares and spears into pruning-hooks. Men were
to “call no man master.” But it must be noticed that
this second government pertained only to those who
had come under the rule of charity and love, and thus
had put off the old man and his deeds. So long as the
individual, in his affections and lusts, continued in
bondage to the impulses of his animal nature, he belonged
to the first dispensation, and must be continued
under tutors and governors until the coming into him
of Christ.</p>

<p>Here, then, we see the two classes of errors into
which mankind have fallen, the first by supposing that
the laws of selfishness and force were applicable to all
planes, and that the Christian could find authority
under Moses. The second, by supposing that the laws
of selfishness and force were to be abolished in every
plane, not thinking that such law is just as necessary
at one time as another, so long as man continues under
that plane of impulse. Herein we can see the wisdom
of Jesus in his teachings. He came not to destroy the
law, or take it away from man, but his mission was to
take man away from the law, and thus to fulfill or consummate
the uses of the law. He condemned not the
law of force as applicable to those who, in their selfishness
and lusts, were under its dominion. And he did
not propose to emancipate them by destroying the law.
But he did propose to redeem them from under it, by
calling them to a higher plane of impulse and action.
He proposed to lead them out of Egypt, not take
Egypt away from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>Herein is to be found one of the fundamental errors
of Christendom, in not perceiving the true meaning of
the <i>first</i> and <i>second</i> covenants; that is, in not perceiving
the true sphere of the Mosaic and Christian governments.
Each are of divine appointment in their respective
spheres; and neither have respect to time or
place of administration, but to condition. The Mosaic,
which is a figure representing the governments of
force addressed to man as a selfish being, will never be
at an end so long as society is in a condition to require
that kind of administration. It will not be at an
end in the individual until his moral nature is in the
ascendant, until he keeps that new commandment of
“Love one another.” And the Mosaic dispensation
will not be at an end in society until the kingdom of
heaven is established in the hearts of the members
thereof.</p>

<p>The theologian has committed a great error in making
the kingdom of heaven a historic affair, supposing
that the death of Jesus terminated the first, and
introduced the second dispensation, not seeming to
understand that the <i>character</i> of the government determined
to which dispensation it belonged irrespective
of time or place. That government which is instituted
with respect to, and is administered upon the
principles of selfishness and force, is Mosaic, no matter
in what age or by whom administered. All civil and
ecclesiastical governments which are external and
forceful belong to the Mosaic, no matter by what names
they may be called. A moment’s reflection will demonstrate
to a mind of ordinary intelligence and information,
that all external human governments are of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
this character. We have no Christian governments
exercising power and compelling external obedience
to law. The very supposition is an absurdity. The
very moment a government is organized, and clothes
itself with external force, its <i>Christian</i> character is
destroyed.</p>

<p>Christianity, in its true spiritual and saving character,
acts only from <i>within</i> the <i>individual</i>. It is not a
government over men or among men. It is a government
in man. It cleanses the <i>inside</i> of the cup and
the platter, and <i>thence</i> makes clean the outside. Christians
have no need of governments to keep them in the
right way. Understand me—<i>real</i> Christians, not <i>professing</i>
ones. They have no uses for institutions, for
each obeys the right, and takes upon himself the labor
of all needful charities.</p>

<p>Thus it will be found to be a truth of universal applicability,
that wherever institutions, and especially
legal institutions, are found necessary, the people are
not Christians, no matter what creed they profess.
Christianity pertains to <i>character</i>, not <i>creed</i>. External
institutions are incompatible with true Christianity.
Both can not live and act together in the same individual.
Men have been conscious of this, and hence
have been involved in doubt and difficulty as to their
duties. But there need be no difficulty on this point.
Let it be understood, that the man who feels the needs
of outward restraint belongs to the Mosaic government,
and by it he must be governed; that all men who
are under the dominion of their selfish natures have
not put on Christ, and hence are under Moses. Such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
are under the law, and must be continued under
“tutors and governors.”</p>

<p>External institutions, then, belong to the first dispensation,
and will continue to be necessary so long as
man continues to live under the dominion of his selfishness
and lusts. When he shall be redeemed from
such nature in himself, he will be redeemed from bondage
to external institutions, and he can not properly
be before. The evil, then, is not in the institution, but
in that condition of the individual and society which
makes the institution necessary; and the remedy is not
in destroying the institution, but in elevating man,
and thereby dispensing with its need; and until that
is done, the law and the prophets must continue.</p>

<p>This brings me directly to the <i>institution</i> of Marriage,
respecting which so much has been said of late.
Like all other <i>institutions</i>, it belongs to the external
and Mosaic, and looks to the external relations of the
parties. Its necessity is based upon the same selfish
and lustful principle in man, as is the necessity of all
other external institutions.</p>

<p>Its office is <i>protection</i>, not <i>purification</i>. Hence all
its laws look to legal security, but do not attempt to
elevate and purify the affections. Those who have
written and spoken against the external marriage institution
have acted very unphilosophically in supposing
that the fault of which they complain was in the institution
and not in themselves. I will endeavor to make
this apparent.</p>

<p>In the first place, I will do them the justice to say,
that the external institution is in character but little,
if any, better than they affirm of it; that it is made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
the means of rendering respectable the grossest lusts;
that there is no Christian difference between lust <i>within</i>
and lust <i>without</i> the forms of wedlock; that the individual
who looks upon another with a lustful desire,
when tried by the standard of Jesus, is an adulterer,
whether sustaining the external marital relation or not.</p>

<p>In speaking of the <i>abuses</i> of this institution, I would
not have them abate their zeal by ceasing to proclaim
its infidelity to that inward purity of soul so essential
to the true Christian union; but I would have them
make a very different use of the fact.</p>

<p>The use which many, and perhaps most of those who
oppose the external institution of marriage make of its
lustful abuses, is rather to palliate the conduct of those
who are lustful outside of its license, by showing that,
at heart, they do not differ from those who indulge in
the same lustful desires and exercises <i>under</i> its licentious
permission; thus very naturally taking license,
and, when censured by others, pleading the respectable
guilt of others as their excuse.</p>

<p>In speaking of the abuses of the marriage institution,
I would not plead them in mitigation of lust;
nor would I make them the occasion of license. I
would refer to them for the purpose of condemning
more strongly the foul practice of seeking gratification
in that direction.</p>

<p>It is not to be objected to the external institution
of marriage that under its sanction the grossest of
lusts are practiced in the name of virtue, and that the
weightiest evils are the result. Such is not the fault
of the institution, but of those who use it for that purpose;
and were it not for the institution, under the
present lustful condition of society, the same practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
would become universal, and would be as respectable
as it now is under the sanctions of wedlock. If the
external institution does not restrain the exercise of
lust between the parties thereof, it does render disreputable
its exercise beyond, and thus exerts an influence
for good to that extent. It does not make the comer
thereunto perfect in his character; but it tends to restrain
him in the exercise of his lust toward others,
and thus confines its evils to a narrower sphere. One
of the greatest moral benefits of the legal institution
of marriage is that it tends to restrict the lustful
practices of the parties to themselves; and, in reality,
this is the bondage of which the objector complains.</p>

<p>The advocate of that which is called "free love"
complains that under the legal institution of marriage
the parties are prohibited from following their attractions
or passional affinities; that although they might
have been suited to each other at the time of the union,
that circumstances and tastes have changed; that love
requires variety, and that in matters of love each ought
to be at liberty to follow its leadings. The first great
error into which the advocate of free love falls is in
mistaking <i>lust</i> for <i>love</i>. The doctrine that love changes
is a fundamental error, and of itself demonstrates that
the objector has mistaken <i>lust</i> for love. The true impulse
known as love has an immutable basis, and will
be as constant as the relation and need through which
and for which it became manifest.</p>

<p>The nature of <i>hunger</i> and <i>thirst</i>, as expressive of the
needs of the body for food and drink, never changes;
and the gratification incident to the proper supply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
of those needs never changes until abuse and disease
have wrought their work. Man’s desire for particular
kinds of food may change; but that has respect
to lustful gratification rather than the supply of a real
need.</p>

<p>Remembering our definition of lust to be <i>a desire
for self-gratification</i>, we shall find that this <i>change</i>
and <i>variety</i> in food and drink looks more to the gratification
of desires than to the fulfilling of needs, and
therefore belongs to the class of lusts.</p>

<p>True love never changes. From its nature it can
not. It being that impulse which indicates an affectional
need, it must be as unchanging as the soul and
God. Take that known as maternal love, and who
that has known a mother’s love will say that it demands
for its life and continuance variety and change? Tell
the mother, as she presses her first-born to her bosom,
that she will soon demand change and variety to keep
alive her maternal affection, and she would reply in
the language of Macduff, “He has no children.” No,
of all things else, true love will admit of no change,
no variety.</p>

<p>In no affectional relation, save that of husband and
wife, would the free lover admit that love required
change or variety. In the parental, fraternal, filial,
and social relations that doctrine does not apply.
The parent loves his child, and feels no demand for
variety.</p>

<p>What would be thought of that mother who should
tire of loving her child, and give as an excuse that her
tastes had changed; that once her child was suited to
her maternal affection; but that now her maternal love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
had changed its character and quality, and demanded
a corresponding change on the part of the object of
its affection? It requires no argument to show that
such can never be the requirements of maternal love.
The same is true of every other manifestation of the
affectional principle. Fraternal, filial, and social love
will admit of no change; demand no variety. The
brother and sister can love on and love forever; the
parent and child can do the same; and true friendship
abides in constancy of affection. But <i>lust</i> demands
variety, and consequently change. When the true
impulse is overlooked, and self-gratification becomes
the end in pursuit, then comes with it the demand for
variety. This is seen in eating and drinking. Hunger
and thirst only call for simple food and drink. They
will supply the demand. But the moment gratification
is consulted, then great must be the change and
large the variety. And by far the largest amount of
labor and expense is bestowed upon gratification.</p>

<p>The same is seen in the social department. Those
who, in their social intercourse, are seeking selfish gratification
instead of the happiness and well-being of
their associates, are those who demand variety; who
themselves are <i>cloying</i> of one kind of amusement, and
then demanding another. This principle of demanding
change in food, in society, in amusement, etc., depends
upon that condition known as <i>cloyed</i>; and it
does not take place in respect to any need. The thirsty
soul is never cloyed with drink until it ceases to be
thirsty; the hungry soul with food until hunger ceases.
But it is not thus with lust; it ceases to enjoy one
means of gratification after another, while yet the demand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
mand for gratification continues. The same principles
apply to the marriage relation. True conjugal love
never changes. It can never change, because it must
rest upon an unchangeable basis. The mode of begetting
offspring must be as enduring as the race. The
demand, therefore, will be as imperative as the necessity,
and hence the desire for offspring must be as
deep and fundamental as the soul itself.</p>

<p>The law of procreation demands that in view of the
great end to be accomplished, those who unite in the
procreative art should unite upon the highest and
purest plane. Hence the conjugal affection or love has
its basis in this deepest and most immutable necessity
of the soul. Understand me—man, in his present
condition, is the grand ultimate of all past being and
action. And that which took all past ages to accomplish
is committed to man in the command to be fruitful
and multiply. The future is committed to him.
That which comes into conscious being must do so
through him, and the true foundation for the fulfillment
of the great command is laid in the conjugal union of
the male and female souls. To say of the impulse
calling for such union, that it demands change and
consequent variety, is blasphemously false and absurd.
The basis of conjugal love is as deep and immutable
as are the foundations of immortality and eternal life.</p>

<p>But let this union be a mere external and lustful one,
that is, one looking for self-gratification, and it becomes
subject to the law of lust, and consequently, like every
other lustful affection, will demand variety. The very
nature of lust is to disease and destroy and to defeat
the end sought. It therefore brings with itself ulti<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>mate
cloying and disgust; and to remedy that, it must
have change.</p>

<p>That this is the nature of that impulse which <i>free
lovers</i> mistake for love, is further evident from its associations.
The plea they set up is, that every one is
free to seek happiness; and consequently when one
relation or pursuit fails to conduce to that end, they
should be permitted to change the relation or the pursuit,
and seek happiness in another. They make the
seeking after happiness the great end of life; hence
they have adopted very appropriate language, such as
"passional attraction," "passional affinity," etc.</p>

<p>For this reason, in their assemblies they aim at self-gratification.
Each is striving to beget pleasure. Their
assembly-rooms are full of amusements and “innocent
recreations,” singing, dancing, playing at different
games, chatting, etc., all pursued in respect to
the pleasures they promise, and not in respect to the
good irrespective of the pleasure. The plea is, the
people demand cheap amusements, or rather need them.
Cheap amusements are the very things they ought not
to have. It is but another name for cheap dissipation.
But the advocate for free love complains that the law
and public sentiment hold him to his choice, when he
has made a bad one. The uses and benefits of the law
are seen in this, that they do hold all such to their
choice, and by so doing avoid a multiplicity of bad
matches.</p>

<p>The individual who is out seeking passional affinities
is under the influence of lust, and the sooner he
or she is caught and caged the better; such can gain
nothing by being permitted to experiment. Until they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
can rise above their selfish and lustful natures in other
things, they will not be very likely to do it in matrimonial
affairs.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
